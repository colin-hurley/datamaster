Most sounds have both a minimum radius and a maximum radius. Inside the minimum radius,
the sound will be played at full volume. Outside of it, the sound will gradually fade. And outside
of the maximum radius, the sound will not be audible. The 0x2000 flag makes the sound fade
in much less distance outside of the minimum radius.
