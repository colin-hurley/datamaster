<H2>Sound Flags</H2><HR>

Sound Flags are used to control the different types of sounds that can be played in JK. They are:
Thing, Class, Position, Local, and Global sounds. Here's a description of each:
<UL>
<B>Thing:</B> These sounds are played at the position of a thing with
<A href="../../cog/verbs/sound/playsoundthing.html">PlaySoundThing()</A>. But
without the 0x80 Sound Flag, a Thing sound is little more than a Position sound.
<P>
<B>Class:</B> Class sounds are played by a thing's soundclass (*.snd). These flags act like
Thing sounds, but are much different. <A href="../../cog/verbs/sound/playsoundclass.html">PlaySoundClass()</A>
can be used to play these sounds.
<P>
<B>Position:</B> Position sounds are played by Cog with <A href="../../cog/verbs/sound/playsoundpos.html">PlaySoundPos()</A>.
<P>
<B>Local:</B> Local sounds are played by Cog with <A href="../../cog/verbs/sound/playsoundlocal.html">PlaySoundLocal()</A>.
Unlike Thing and Position sounds, Local sounds have no origin. Therefore they can be heard from anywhere
in the level at the same volume.
<P>
<B>Global:</B> Global sounds are the same as Local sounds except that they are played
on all computers in a multiplayer game. Hence the "local" and "global" designations.
</UL>
Not all Sound Flags apply to all types of sounds. If a Sound Flag only works with a few
sound types, then it will list them in its description. But if the description does not list
any sound types, then it is meant to work with all sounds.
<P>
There is no way with Cog to access a sound's flags ingame, but doubtless the engine can. So perhaps
some of the unknown flags are used by the engine alone for the purpose of playing the sound.
Also, some of the unknown Sound Flags (such as 0x2) may affect the CD music. But JK does have
problems changing the music's volume on some systems, so it is possible that some of the unknown
flags will work only on some systems.
