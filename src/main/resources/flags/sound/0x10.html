<H2>0x10 Sound Flag</H2><HR>

When this flag is given to a sound, it will play with a very low volume - as if you could
barely hear the sound. The 0x10 Sound Flag does not work well with local and global
sounds. There's a small burst of normal volume sound before the low volume is given
to the sound.
