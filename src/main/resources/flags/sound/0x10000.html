<H2>0x10000 Sound Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x10000 Sound Flag only affects other Thing and Class sounds that have the flag
and are associated with the same thing. For a Thing sound to be "associated with a thing,"
it must be played with the 0x80 Sound Flag so that its origin will be a thing instead of a
position. Class sounds don't need the 0x80 flag.
<P>
When a sound is played with the 0x10000 flag, no other Thing or Class sound with the flag
can play until the first sound has finished. This flag is typically used with voices so that
a creature won't say two lines at the same time.
