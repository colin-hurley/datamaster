<H2>0x8000 Weapon Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x8000 flag is a dependent flag of 0x2000 or 0x10000. When either combination
is used, the weapon will use its elementsize and range template settings to create
a string of trailthings from the projectile's starting point to its projected destination.
<P>
The 0x10000 gives the added effect of semi-random direction for each trailthing; the
weapon will use its trailcylradius and trailrandangle to make the trailthings only loosely
follow the path of the parent weapon. More at 0x10000.
