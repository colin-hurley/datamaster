<H2>0x2000 Weapon Flag</H2><HR>

When a weapon is given this flag, it will be removed shortly after
its creation. Its explosion will be created at the end of its range or
at any surface blocking its path. The weapon must have a range
template property for this flag to work.
<P>
This Weapon Flag also allows 0x8000 to create trailthings after weapon.
Because the destination is known, JK can create trailthings along the
weapon's projected destination.
<P>
The template properties elementsize and range must be used for this flag.
