<H2>0x400 Weapon Flag</H2><HR>

The lightsaber's blade and tip are engine-created surfaces. These are most likely
not magsealed surfaces because laser blocking is more than just a bolt
reflecting off a surface.
<P>
Because the flag has more than one purpose, it seems to be more of a symbolic flag
than one with a specific effect. LEC may have intended that this flag be used to
designate laser weapons.
