<H2>0x10000 Weapon Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x10000 Weapon Flag is seemingly an improvement on 0x2000's effect.
The direct effect of both flags is to remove the weapon after creation and
create an explosion at its expected destination.
<P>
The difference between the flags is their effect when used with 0x8000. With
the 0x18000 flags, the weapon will use its trailcylradius and trailrandangle
properties (as well as trailthing and range) to give the trailthings a semi-random
effect.
<P>
JK's force_lightning is well-known example. Notice that each lightning piece veers
off from the projectile's path (according to trailrandangle), but a piece never goes farther
astray than the trailcylradius distance. Also note that the engine "connects" the trailthings
so that the ending point of the last trailthing is the starting point of the next.
<P>
As with 0x2000, elementsize and range must be used for this flag.
