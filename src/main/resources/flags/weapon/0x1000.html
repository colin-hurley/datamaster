<H2>0x1000 Weapon Flag</H2><HR>

After a weapon is given this flag, it will explode when it collides with a thing.
But since weapons cannot collide with each other, it cannot be exploded
by another weapon. The secondary sequencer is given the flag and a large
collision sphere by its class cog. And the next time a thing collides with the sequencer,
it will explode.
