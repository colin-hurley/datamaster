<H2>Collide Type 1</H2><HR>

Sphere collision makes an object collide depending on its distance from other objects and surfaces. For the
object to collide, this distance has to be less than the object's size radius which is set in its template. The
movesize radius is used when the object is moving. Because the object can be approached and collided
with from any direction, there is the illusion of a sphere around the object.
