<H2>Collide Type 3</H2><HR>

With face collision, the object's 3d model determines when the object has collided. A face, in this case, is
one of the surfaces of the object's model. An object using face collision will collide whenever one of the
model's faces enters another object's collision sphere or hits another (sur)face.
