<H2>0x8 Attach Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x8 Attach Flag causes the events and physics of the attached thing to be ignored. The most
important feature of this flag is that the attached thing stays the same distance away from the base object
that it was when it was attached.
<P>
When the base object of the attachment is a player, the purpose of the flag changes slightly. When the player
moves, the attached thing will be kept at the same distance, but it will be placed along the player's lookvector.
