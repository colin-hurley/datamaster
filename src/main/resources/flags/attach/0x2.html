<H2>0x2 Attach Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x2 Attach Flag can be unstable - on some computers more so than others. When it works, the 0x2
flag also causes the physics of the attached thing to be ignored. For example, the attached thing can move through walls.
The 0x2 flag is very similar to the 0x8 flag.
