When surfaces are set to this mode, they will not be rendered. If the surface
is an adjoin, you will be able to see through it into the next sector. If the surface
is a sector wall and is not an adjoin, then a "Hall of Mirrors" effect will be created
because there is nothing behind the surface for the engine to render.
