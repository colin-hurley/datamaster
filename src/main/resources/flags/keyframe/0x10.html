<H2>0x10 Keyframe Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x10 flag is used with external animations to make them finish in time when stopped
with a delay. That is, when they are given a delay other than zero by
<A href="../../cog/verbs/keyframe/stopkey.html">StopKey()</A>. If the animation is given even
a small delay, it will run through all of its frames to finish in that delay if it has the 0x10 flag.
<P>
This flag was refered to by LEC as a flag meaning "unique." It's unclear what they
meant by that, but it may apply.
<P>
<A href="../../cog/verbs/keyframe/stopkey.html">StopKey()</A> and the 0x10 flag can be used
to speed up keyframes, though the effect is not as good as if the keyframe had been made faster.
