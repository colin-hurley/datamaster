<H2>0x4 Item Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x4 Item flag shows that an item is a backpack containing the bin values of a player. This flag
is set in the +backpack template, but even if it isn't, <A href="../../cog/verbs/multiplayer/createbackpack.html">CreateBackpack()</A>
will add the flag. Unless the backpack has the 0x4 flag, <A href="../../cog/verbs/multiplayer/pickupbackpack.html">PickupBackup()</A>
and the NthBackpack verbs will not work with it.
