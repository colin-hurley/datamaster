<H2>0x1 Sub Mode Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x1 flag is set by JK for multiplayer games. When the player dies while this
flag is set, the level will not be reset as it is in normal SP games. Everything will
be where it was and in the same state that it was when the player died. Clearing
this flag in an MP game and killing the player will crash the game.
