Sub Mode Flags are strange in that their name suggests nothing about what they're for.
They're known to exist because they have verbs to clear, get, and set them. But
it seems that these flags are not to be used by Cog. As you can see from the flag descriptions,
these flags pertain more to the workings of the engine than to special effects.
