<H2>0x40 Inventory Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x40 bin flag causes the bin's value to be reset to the minimum value
when the next level in an episode is loaded. Bin values are normally retained
in successive episode levels. But should you load a level from a different episode
or a multiplayer level, all bin values will be reset.
