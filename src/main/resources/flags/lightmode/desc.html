<H2>Light Modes</H2><HR>

Light modes are used by 3dos, things, and sector surfaces to determine
how their faces should be lighted. The default light mode for most objects is
mode 3 for gouraud lighting.
<P>
In the advanced display options, you can set the lighting for all objects
in the game. But this setting does not directly affect the objects' modes.
They will still have their original light modes because the engine does not
update them.
<P>
At one time, it was thought that there were other light modes above 3 that
had the same effect as gouraud. That's because if you use any number
higher than 3 as a light mode, it will have the same effect as mode 3.
