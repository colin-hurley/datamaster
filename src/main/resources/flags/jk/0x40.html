<H2>0x40 Jedi Knight Flag</H2><HR>

Unlike the rest of the Jedi Knight Flags, it seems that 0x40 is for actors only. It
is set by some actors' saber attack keyframes to allow the actor to damage a player
twice in the same keyframe. Keyframe marker 14 triggers this flag to be set.
<P>
After 0x40 has been set, the 0x2 flag can be set and the player can be damaged
by the next part of the keyframe. But if 0x40 is not set, keyframe marker 4 (which
triggers 0x2 to be set) will not cause 0x2 to be added and no damage will be done
to the player.
<P>
The 0x40 flag is not used in the player's saber keyframes because it doesn't seem
to be needed for players. Marker 4 can set the 0x2 flag again regardless.
