<H2>0x10 Jedi Knight Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x10 flag is very similar to 0x1. It shows that the creature has another saber.
If 0x10 is set when the 0x4 flag is added, JK will ignite the creatures second saber -
should he have one. But unlike 0x1, 0x10 will not be cleared after 0x8 is used
to shrink the creature's sabers.
