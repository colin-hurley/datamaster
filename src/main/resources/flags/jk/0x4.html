<H2>0x4 Jedi Knight Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x4 flag is used to ignite the saber. The 0x1 flag must be set for 0x4
to ignite the saber. 0x4 can be used to ignite two sabers. For this, the 0x10
flag must be set -  showing that the creature uses a second saber.
<P>
As soon as the saber finishes its ignition, the 0x4 flag will clear itself. Actors
will set 0x4 on their own when they sense the player, but they still must have
0x1 (and for the second saber 0x10) set to do it.
