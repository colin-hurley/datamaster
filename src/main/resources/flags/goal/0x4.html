<H2>0x4 Goal Flag</H2><HR>

This flag is used for secret objectives.
When a goal is given this flag, the objective will be displayed with yellow text instead of the usual green in the objectives window.
<P>
In JK level 18 (Descent into the Valley), there is a secret objective for finding the safe entrance to sub level 2.
This objective is completed by going under an elevator into a hidden room near the start of the level.
This is apparently the only time LEC used this flag, making this the only secret objective in the game.
