<H2>0x80 Cog Flag</H2><HR>

When this flag is given to an item or class cog, the engine will not assign the 0x40 Cog Flag. LEC
recognized that some class cogs should not function locally, so they created the 0x80 flag to
mark cogs that should not be given 0x40.
<P>
For whatever reason, this flag only works in MotS. It is used in several JK class cogs, but it has
no apparent effect - messages are handled on client computers anyway.
