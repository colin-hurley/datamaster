<H2>0x200 Cog Flag</H2><HR>

A cog will normally sync certain effects (such as thing creation, sounds, animations, etc) with other computers. When the 0x200
Cog Flag is assigned to a cog, it will not sync the effect. Instead, the effect will only occur locally, and
the other computers in the game will not be affected.
