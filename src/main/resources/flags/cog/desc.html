Cogscripts Flags control how the engine handles a cog - especially in multiplayer. Cogscript Flags can be given to a cog by an
assignment just above the symbols section. Such as:
<P>
<CODE>flags=0x40</CODE>
<P>
Note that this is a special assignment - unlike assignments in the code section. The flags assignment
does not end with a semicolon and spaces are not allowed. Should you use spaces or incompatible flags, the engine will
print an error when it tries to use the cog saying that the cog has been "disabled" and that the message sent to it was
ignored.
<P>
Cogs have default flags. These flags are assigned to cogs by the engine and cannot be removed in JK. When
a cog is given flags via the flags assignment, the default flags are not overwritten. Instead, the flags are added.
<P>
There are basically three types of cogs: item cogs which are used by the items.dat, class cogs which are used by
templates, and JKL or level cogs which are used by a JKL for level-specific purposes. The engine treats
each type of cog differently when assigning default flags.
