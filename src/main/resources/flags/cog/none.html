<H2>No Flags</H2><HR>

When a cog has no flags, not even the default flags given to item and class cogs, it will
have these multiplayer characteristics:
<P>
Server only / Forwarded event messages: The cog will forward event messages to the server. Messages
that are sent to all cogs on a client computer (such as startup) will not be forwarded - they will still be
handled locally. But messages like damaged, entered, and created will be sent to the server to
be handled.
<P>
Some events, such as created, occur on all computers in a game (global events), but when clients forward
this event message to the server, the server will only see it as one message. And the created event
need not occur on the server's computer for him to recognize the forwarded message.
<P>
Synced effects: Normally, a cog will broadcast information to the other computers
in a game to sync certain events - like the creation of a thing. But note that not all events are meant
to be synced or work on other players' computers.
