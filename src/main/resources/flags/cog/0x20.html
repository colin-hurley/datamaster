<H2>0x20 Cog Flag</H2><HR>

Although the effect of this flag is unknown, it is given to all class cogs by default. It may
be a flag meant to be used by the engine only since there is no way to change the flag in JK.
If it were not for the MotS Cog Flag verbs, there would have been no way to know this flag
was used.
