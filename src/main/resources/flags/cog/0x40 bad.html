<H2>0x40 Cog Flag</H2><HR>

When a cog has this flag, it will run on all computers. Because each computer in an MP game
is responsible for the things it creates (0x100 Thing Flag), events cannot occur on all computers.
A thing's events occur only on the computer that created it. When a cog has the 0x40 Cog Flag,
it will send a duplicate message out to all of the other computers in the game so that their cogs
can also handle the event.
<P>
The engine will assign this flag to all item and class cogs by default.
