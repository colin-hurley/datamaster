<H2>0x2000 Actor Flag</H2><HR>

An actor or player with this flag will deflect projectiles with their lightsaber.
Only projectiles with the 0x400 weapon flag will be deflected.
<P>
The game automatically sets and clears this flag in some cases.
If an actor has the 0x200 actor flag, the 0x2000 flag will be set.
When an actor uses the SaberFighting instinct, this flag will be cleared during an attack and set after the attack is finished.
When an actor or player is killed, this flag will be cleared.
<P>
In MotS, the <A href="../../cog/message/preblock.html">preblock</A> message must also be handled in order for a player or actor to deflect projectiles.
