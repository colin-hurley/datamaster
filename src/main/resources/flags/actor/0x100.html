<H2>0x100 Actor Flag</H2><HR>

Force powers such as Grip and Blinding have the condition:
<P>
<CODE>&& !(GetActorFlags(potential) & 0x100)</CODE>
<P>
in their target-finding code. Actors that shouldn't be affected by these
force powers, such as probedroids and ATSTs, are
given this flag so the powers can't be used on them.
