<H2>0x4 MP Mode Flag</H2><HR>

When this flag is set, the engine will not update a player's or team's score. The kills, self kills,
and deaths totals will be updated, but the overall scores will remain unchanged. When
the flag is cleared, the engine will again update the player's and team's scores the next time
the scores are refreshed.
