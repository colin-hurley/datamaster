<H2>0x1 Camera State Flag</H2><HR>

When 0x1 is set before the camera starts idling, the camera will not rotate for the entire
time the player idles. But when it is set during the idle, it is only temporary. The flag can
be removed and the camera will resume its rotation.
<P>
0x1 is cleared on startup whenever a new level is loaded. It's not cleared when the
same level is reloaded.
