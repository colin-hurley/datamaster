<H2>0x8 Thing Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x8 Thing Flag affects the way things are rendered behind translucent surfaces.
LEC used the 0x8 flag to mark things that should or might be rendered behind
translucency. And they used it mainly with things used for the level or as part of level
architecture. The 0x8 Thing Flag provides a way to raise the priorty of a thing for the
rendering engine, but does not completely solve the problem.
<P>
Below are three pictures which show three elevators on their side. The two in front
have translucent 3dos. In this picture, all elevs have the 0x8 flag:

<P>
The effect ingame of giving all the elevs 0x8 is similar to looking at HOM through a translucent suface.
In this next picture, none have the 0x8 flag:

<P>
As you can see, the result is terrible. The 0x8 flag must be given to the back elevator:

Now, the result isn't perfect. JK has problems with rendering
through more than one translucent surface. This next set of examples uses only two
elevs. Only the one in front is translucent. Here, both have the 0x8 flag:
<P>

<P>
Clearly, 0x8 should not be given to the translucent elev. In this picture, 0x8 is given only
to the back elevator:
<P>
<IMG src="../../pics/2_back0x8.jpg">
<P>
JK handles this flawlessly. There are no clipping problems at any angle. So to sumarize,
<B>the 0x8 Thing Flag should be given to all things which do not have translucent
surfaces and are used for a level or as level architecture.</B>
