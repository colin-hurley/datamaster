When a thing pulse has been set by <A href="../../cog/verbs/message/setthingpulse.html">SetThingPulse()</A>,
the given thing is assigned the 0x20000 Thing Flag. The thing will then send the <A href="../../cog/message/pulse.html">pulse</A>
message to all of its associated cogs. If this flag is cleared from the thing, then the pulse will end.
