<H2>0x400 Thing Flag</H2><HR>

A thing will send messages to its associated cogs when it has this flag. Without the flag,
no messages will be sent. The 0x400 flag is assigned by the engine when the thing's value is passed
from a JKL to a cog's symbol, the thing has a class cog, or when the thing is captured
(via <A href="../../cog/verbs/thingact/capturething.html">CaptureThing()</A>).
