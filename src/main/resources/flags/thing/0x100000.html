<H2>0x100000 Thing Flag</H2><HR>

This flag is given to a thing after it has been seen by the camera. The thing need
not have a model to be "seen," it only has to have been in the camera's field of
view. The 0x100000 flag is reset about every tenth of a second. So it's probably
a flag meant to be used only by the engine.
