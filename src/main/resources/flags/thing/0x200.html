<H2>0x200 Thing Flag</H2><HR>

When a thing has this flag, it is either dead or dying. Targeting code for force powers usually
checks for this flag to make sure dead things aren't targeted. The targeting code cannot directly
check a player's health because health is not synced, so instead the 0x200 flag is used.
<P>
The engine checks to make sure that a player does not have this flag before giving him movement in
response to new keyboard input. Also, pressing fire or space while the player has this flag will make
the level restart in SP and make a player respawn in MP.
