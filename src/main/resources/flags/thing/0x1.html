<H2>0x1 Thing Flag</H2><HR>

When a thing has this flag, it will use its light template setting to create a lighting effect
at its position. If the thing has a light property in its template and the 0x1 flag is not set
when the level is loaded, JK will set the flag. Setting and clearing this flag ingame will
enable / disable the lighting effect.
