<H2>0x1000 Surface Flag</H2><HR>

When a surface has the 0x1000 flag, any things that are attached to it will gain momentum more easily.
The 0x2000 flag is very similar except the things gain momentum even more easily.
<P>
These flags create an effect that makes the surface feel more steep or slippery.
For example, when the player stands still on an ordinary floor surface with an incline, he will stick in place.
But when the 0x1000 or 0x2000 flags are added to that surface, the player will start sliding down.
