<H2>0x20 Surface Flag</H2><HR>

Normally, when a surface is scrolling, the surface and any things attached to it move at the same speed.
The 0x20 flag causes the surface texture to scroll at half the speed that the things attached to the surface are moving.
<P>
This flag must be set before a call to <A href="../../cog/verbs/animcel/slidesurface.html">SlideSurface()</A>.
Setting the flag afterward will have no effect unless SlideSurface() is called again.
