<H2>0x2 Surface Flag</H2><HR>

When a surface is given the 0x2 flag, it will send its event messages to all cogs that reference
it. JK will assign this flag by default to any surface whose value was passed from a JKL
to a cog's symbol. You may set and clear this flag ingame to enable or disable the surface's
messages.
