<H2>0x40 Surface Flag</H2><HR>

Normally, when a surface is scrolling, the surface and any things attached to it move at the same speed.
The 0x40 flag causes the surface texture to scroll at 1/8 the speed that the things attached to the surface are moving.
<P>
This flag must be set before a call to <A href="../../cog/verbs/animcel/slidesurface.html">SlideSurface()</A>.
Setting the flag afterward will have no effect unless SlideSurface() is called again.
