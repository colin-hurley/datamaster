Each thing type has a number assigned to it. Knowing this number is useful because
if you needed to find the type of a thing ingame, the only way to do it is to get the thing's
type number. You would use code similar to:
<P>
<CODE>if(GetThingType(potential) == 10) // then thing is a player</CODE>
<P>
With <A href="../../cog/verbs/thingprop/setthingtype.html">SetThingType()</A>, it is possible to
change a thing's type ingame. But this is <I>not</I> recommended.
<P>
The first two thing types listed here, free and camera, are not known to function and were
never used. But they are in an exe listing of thing types. And this listing is in order of their
thing type number.
<P>
Note that these thing types are not related to message types. Message type
values are a property of messages and are not used with things directly.
