<H2>0x4 Face Type Flag</H2><HR>

Although the purpose of the 0x4 flag is unknown, it is used in almost every level. Both
JED and JkEdit assign the 0x4 flag to <I>every</I> visible surface. This is apparently
not what the flag was intended for. In the LEC levels that use this flag, you can almost
see a pattern in the surfaces that use it, but not every surface does use it. And in LEC
levels, this flag is sometimes assigned to adjoins.
<P>
Notably, the two SP narshaada levels do not use the 0x4 flag. So either the flag does
something and it's not important, or the flag has been abandoned.
<P>
The 0x4 Face Type Flag is cleared from every surface before startup.
