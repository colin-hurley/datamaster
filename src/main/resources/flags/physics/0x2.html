<H2>0x2 Physics Flag</H2><HR>

A thrust is a type of movement for objects. It represents a constant force
that is applied to an object. This is how the player moves ingame. Without
the 0x2 flag, an object will not accept this type of movement, and Cog verbs
such as <A href="../../cog/verbs/velocity/setthingthrust.html">SetThingThrust()</A> will have no effect.
