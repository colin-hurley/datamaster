<H2>0x10 Physics Flag</H2><HR>

This flag will make an object align itself perpendicularly with the surface that it's
attached to. This can be seen in the attachment of sequencer charges in that they
always lie flat on a surface. This flag is also given to creatures' bodies when they
die so that they will lie prone on the surface they fall on.
