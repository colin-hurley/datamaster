<H2>Texture Mode 0</H2><HR>

With affine texturing, there is no consideration for a surface's depth. In reality, each
vertex of a surface is more or less distant from a viewpoint than another. But with affine
texturing, the whole surface is rendered as if all points were the same distance from the
viewpoint. The surfaces are textured as if they directly faced the player.
<P>
This is something like the rendering of sprites. With affine texturing, surfaces appear
to bulge because the textures don't seem to follow the contour of the surfaces that use them.
<P>
Affine texturing cannot be used with 3d acceleration. JK will always use perspective texturing
when this setting is enabled.
