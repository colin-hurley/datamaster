Mask Flags are used to mask or screen out things of an unwanted type. They
are used by symbols that send messages and by some verbs.
<P>
Some of the thing types listed in the mask flags chart, such as free and camera,
aren't known to exist. However, there is a list in the exe of thing types which
includes these types. And this exe list matches the mask flags list. So whether
they exist or not, the information is correct.
