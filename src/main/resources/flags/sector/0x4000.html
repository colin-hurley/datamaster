<H2>0x4000 Sector Flag</H2><HR>

When a sector is given this flag, it will appear on both the UI map and the ingame
overlay map. This flag will be given to a sector when the player has it in view. The sector
will be visible on the maps when it has the flag, unless the sector also has the 0x10 Sector Flag.
In that case, it will not be visible.
