<H2>0x1000 Sector Flag</H2><HR>

COLLIDEBOX is one of a sector's JKL settings. This setting can be ommitted from
the sector's property and value list in the JKL. When the engine finds that a sector has this
setting, it sets the 0x1000 flag. It seems that this is an added safeguard as the flag
is set beforehand in all LEC levels.
