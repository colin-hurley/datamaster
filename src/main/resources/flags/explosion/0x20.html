<H2>0x20 Exposion Flag</H2><HR>

The 0x20 flag has an effect on the orientation of an explosion. Because
sprites are only 2d, the effect can only be seen when the explosion uses
a model3d instead of a sprite.
<P>
What this orientation effect is and how it works are difficult to understand. It
seems that the explosion's original lookvector is used with some vector-crossing
operation to yield the new lvec for the explosion.
