<H2>0x2 Exposion Flag</H2><HR>

Explosion templates have timer and blasttime template settings. Timer sets the time
for the explosion to exist in the game, and blasttime is the time left that the explosion
should have when it explodes. When the explosion does "explode," the force, damage,
debris, etc effects are created. When the 0x2 flag is set, it shows that the explosion
has not exploded. When it does, the 0x2 will be cleared.
<P>
This flag is not only a simple information flag. It is used by the engine to determine whether
it has already created the explosion effects or not. Clearing 0x2 will cause the explosion
not to explode, and setting 0x2 after the explosion will cause it to explode again.
