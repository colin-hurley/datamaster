When using either the command line switch or the console command, dispstats
will display two lines of information at the top of the screen while your playing a level.
It will look like this:

<pre style="font: 10pt arial; font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">
XX.XXX [XXX%]f Xs Xa Xz Xp X curSector X fo
     force: XXX, item: none, force: none,
</pre>

Every capitalized 'x' in the code above is a variable depending on the conditions
in the level you load. Here's what each part of this means:
<p>
<b>XX.XXX [XXX%]f</b>: the first number is the framerate or frames per second. The second
number inside brackets is the percentage that the current framerate is of the max framerate.
The letter 'f' at the end stands for 'framerate.'
<p>
<b>Xs</b>: this is the number of sectors that JK is rendering. The 's' stands
for 'sector.'
<p>
<b>Xa</b>: This is the number of architecture things that JK is rendering (0x8 TF). The 'a' may stand
for 'architectures'.
<p>
<b>Xz</b>: this seems to be the number of thing models that JK is rendering. It's not clear
what the 'z' stands for.
<p>
<b>Xp</b>: this is the number of polygons that JK is rendering. The 'p' stands for 'polygons'.
<p>
<b>X curSector</b>: this number is the current sector that the player is inside of.
<p>
<b>X fo</b>: this number is the number of unused thing variables in the level's array. E.g., if
the level has a thing limit of 200, and the level has only the walkplayer and a stormtrooper in
it, then this number will be 198. The 'fo' may stand for 'freed objects.'
<p>
<b>force: XXX</b>: this is the mana (amount of force ammo) that the player has.
<p>
<b>item: none</b>: this is the item that the player has selected.
<p>
<b>force: none</b>: this is the force power that the player has selected.
