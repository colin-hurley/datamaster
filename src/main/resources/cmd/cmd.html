<h4>Using Switches</h4>

To use a switch, add it after the command that launches JK.exe. You can do this with the Windows run box, with a batch file,
a console, or a shortcut. Shortcuts are easiest. Just create a shortcut to JK.exe and view its properties. On the shortcut tab,
find the target line. There you'll see the path of the Jedi Knight executable. Write in the switch after the path. For example:
<i>C:\games\jedi knight\jk.exe -windowgui</i>
<p>
You can use as many switches as you need, and the order isn't important. As you can see in the examples, the character used
to make the text as a switch can be either a dash or a forward slash - JK will recognize them both. The only exception is devmode,
which doesn't have the forward slash.

<h4>Using Console Commands</h4>

To run console commands, just press the talk key (usually 't') in a singleplayer game, and type the command. For commands in multiplayer,
press the talk key and then press tab to enter the command. This should be obvious, but it's explained here just to make sure everything's
covered.
