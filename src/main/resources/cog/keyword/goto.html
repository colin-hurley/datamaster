Goto is used to jump to a message. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>goto newmsg;</CODE>
<P>
Upon reaching a call statement, the cog will jump to the specified message before continuing execution.
After returning from the message, execution will not resume at the code immediately following the goto statement.
This is the primary difference between <A href="call.html">call</A> and goto.
<P>
Call and goto are the only way to run custom messages.
Goto can be used to loop messages.
There is no limit to the number of jumps that goto can make.
Example:
<PRE class=code style="margin-bottom:0">
activated:
     Print("Activated");
     goto activated;

return;
</PRE>
