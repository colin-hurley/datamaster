The for statement is used to run a statement or code block continuously as long as a condition is true. 
Be careful to make sure that your condition will eventually be false, or the loop will not end. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>for([statement1[, statement1]]; [condition]; statement2[, statement2]) // code to run</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>statement1:</SPAN> Optional. These statements at the beginning of the for loop are executed
only once before the loop begins. More than one statement can be written by seperating the statements with a comma.
These first statements are usually used to initialize a counting variable. For example, i=0.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>condition:</SPAN> Optional. Before executing the loop's code, this condition is checked. If the
condition is true, then the loop's code will be executed. If the condition is false, then the loop will end. If you do not
enter a condition, then the condition will be always true. Then loop's code will keep running until a return or break (in MotS)
command is found in the loop's code and executed.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>statement2:</SPAN> After the loop's code has been run, the last group of statements in the for
loop will be executed. Unlike the first statements, at least one statement must be entered. But like the first statements,
you may have more than one statement by seperating them with a comma. These statements are usually used to
increment a counting variable. For example, i=i+1.
<P>
Although the for loop is usually used to loop code, this is not always the case. The for loop may be ended with
a semicolon and no loop code will be expected. The for loop is a versatile tool, but you should always try to
structure the for loop in such a way that it is easy to read. You should never write something like the last example
below. It's hard to tell by reading it that the output would be 5, 1, 2, 3.

Here's are a few working examples of the for loop:
<P>
<CODE>for(i=0; i < 5; i=i+1) PrintInt(i);<BR>
for(; i < 5; i=i+1) { PrintInt(i); }<BR>
for(; i < x; i=i+1, PrintInt(i));<BR>
x=5;
for(i=1, j=1, PrintInt(x); i=i+1, PrintInt(i), j=j+2)
{
	PrintInt(j);
	if(i > 1) Return;
}
</CODE>
