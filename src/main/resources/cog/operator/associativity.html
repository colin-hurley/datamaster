<H2>Operator Associativity</H2><HR>

The associativity of an operator is the right-to-left or left-to-right direction
that an operator works in. An example:

<PRE class=exam>
var=-5 * 5 * 5;
</PRE>

Three operators are used there. The negation, because of its precedence, is
performed first. Since its associativity is right-to-left, it affects the 5 to its
right. At first this may seem backwards, but think of it from the 5's perspective.
The 5 is affected by the negation operator to its left because the operator
has right-to-left associativity.
<P>
Because the multiplication operators are all of the same precedence, their
associativity is used to determine which operation is done first. And since
their associativity is left-to-right, the -5 * 5 operation is done next. This next
example uses parentheses to show the order in which the first example
was evaluated:

<PRE class=exam>
var=(((-5) * 5) * 5);
</PRE>

Note that the parentheses did not change the expression here, they only
show the order in which the expression would have been evaluated.
The last operation to be performed is the assignment. Since it has the lowest
precedence it is done last. And because it has right-to-left associativity, it
assigns the resultant value on the right to the variable on the left.
