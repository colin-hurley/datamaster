Startup is sent to all cogs after a level has loaded and just before you can see anything. It is called
shortly before the <A href="loading.html">loading</A> message.

<P>
Because startup runs <EM>before</EM> the game fully sets up, there are certain things that
cannot be done at startup - such as working with models. If you encounter one of these
problems, use a short sleep to wait until the game has finished loading. However, do not
assume that putting a sleep in the startup message is a fix-all solution for errors.
