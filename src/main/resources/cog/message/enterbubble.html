Enterbubble is sent by a player when he enters another thing's <A HREF="../verbs/mots/notes.html#bubbles">bubble</A> created by
<A HREF="../verbs/mots/jkCreateBubble.html">jkCreateBubble</A>. The message is sent to all of the player's linked cogs
(including class, capture, and level-linked cogs), as well as all inventory cogs that are both available and have the
0x8 <A HREF="../../flags/inventory/inventory.html">inventory flag</A> set.  Only players cause this message to be sent,
while other thing types, including actors, do not.
<P>
Enterbubble will be sent under any circumstance that causes a player to enter a bubble region.  This could result from
movement of the player or a bubble thing, or if a bubble is resized or created.
