Global0 is the first in a 0-15 series of Global messages. However, only global0
works. The others are listed in the exe, but are not used. Note that global0 uses
0 as its ID. The default value of an undefined variable is also 0. So there is no way to know
if global0 is a predefined variable like other messages.
<P>
Refer to <A href="user0.html">User0</A> for the global0 message information.<HR>
