<H2>Notes on Thing Properties</H2><HR>

Most of the verbs in this section modify the template properties of a thing. This template
property is listed beside the verb.

<A name=userdata><H4>User Data</H4></A>

All things have a user data assigned to them. By default it is 0. The user data was created so that the "user" could store values
with a thing. It can be very useful for attaching values to players. Since the user data is often used by patches, the author recommends
that level authors abstain from using the user data of common things like the player.

<P>
The game does not synchronize user data between computers in multiplayer.

<A name=cogs><H4>Class & Capture Cogs</H4></A>

A thing has a class cog and a capture cog. Both of the thing's cogs receive its messages. A thing's class cog is meant to
control the effects associated with all things of that template. And so it is defined in the template so that all things of the same
"class" have the same class cog.
<P>
A capture cog is meant to "capture" a specific thing once it has been created and receive its messages. And because the
capture cog captures individual things, it is usually used to handle specific things that have a special role in the game.
A capture cog can capture as many things as needed.

<A name=life><H4>Template Timers</H4></A>

Called "life left" in cog, template timers control how long the thing should stay in the game before it's removed. Ever notice
how stormtroopers' bodies don't disappear while you're looking at them? When the body's timer expires, the engine checks to see if you're
close to the body and if you can see it. Based on that, the engine either removes the thing, or gives it a new lease on life of 3 seconds. When
the 3 seconds are over, the engine checks again.

<A name=parent><H4>Thing Parents</H4></A>

Here's an analogy to explain parents: Adam was the first human. To Seth, his child, Adam was the parent. To Seth's children, Adam
was still the parent. But if Seth died and Adam still lived, then the grandchildren will lose their link to Adam and not
find their parent. When these children (or any thing) cannot find their parent, they substitute themselves instead. But if Adam had died and Seth
still lived, Seth would then be the parent of his children. This is how thing parents work in JK.
<P>
Not all verbs will link the things they create to a parent. Only <A href="../weapon/fireprojectile.html">FireProjectile()</A> is known to in JK.
The template settings, creatething, fleshhit, and explode will link the things they create to the parent associated with the projectile that
created them.
<P>
When two things that have the same parent (and are not themselves the parent), they will not collide. For example, a player can
collide with a projectile fired from him, but two projectiles fired from him cannot collide with each other.

<A name=sector><H4>A Thing's Sector</H4></A>

JK bases a lot of operations on things' sectors. <A href="../thingact/setthingpos.html">SetThingPos()</A> would be a good verb to use if it updated
the thing's sector. But since it doesn't, alternatives will have to be used. If you know the sector where the thing should go, use
<A href="../thingact/createthingatpos.html">CreateThingAtPos()</A>. If this is MotS, you can use SetThingSector() or SetThingPosEx(). Or if there's
a thing already there, use <A href="../thingact/teleportthing.html">TeleportThing()</A>.
<P>
If you need to use CreateThingAtPos() but do not know the sector, use the <A href="../../../tutorials/possector.html" target="main">Position's Sector</A>
code from the Tutorial Section's Solution category. This will give you the sector of the position that the thing needs to be created at.

<A name=sig><H4>A Thing's Signature</H4></A>

A thing's signature is a unique number assigned to each thing in the level. Thing signatures start at one greater that the number of the last
thing created. But unlike thing numbers, they are not reused. Signatures are mainly used as a safeguard so the wrong thing is not used by mistake.
Look at this example:

<PRE class=code>
#------------------------
created:
   SetTimerEx(5, 0, GetSenderRef(), GetThingSignature(GetSenderRef()));

Return;
#------------------------
timer:
   if(GetThingSignature(GetParam(0)) == GetParam(1)) DestroyThing(GetParam(0));

Return;
#------------------------
</PRE>

Because thing numbers are reused, the wrong thing may be used by mistake. In the above example, the signature is stored by
the <A href="../../message/created.html">created</A> message, and then after the timer, it is compared to the signature that the thing
is supposed to have. If the signatures are not equal, the sender of the created message had been destroyed. If they match, we
know the thing still exists, and it is safe to destroy.

<P>
As with thing numbers, the game does not synchronize thing signatures between computers in multiplayer.
