<A name=formspec><H4 style="margin-top:0">Format Specifiers</H4></A>

Format specifiers are used by two of the concat verbs to insert values into
a string. You can use different format specifiers to concatenate the value
in a different form. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE class="code">%[-][+][ ][#][0][width][.size][prefix]specifier</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class="param">[-]</SPAN></SPAN> Optional. Add the minus sign to make the value
align to the left inside the width. The default alignment is to the right.
<P>
<SPAN class="param">[+]</SPAN></SPAN> Optional. If used with a specifier that works with
signed numbers, the '+' sign will be put before positive numbers to show their positivity.
<P>
<SPAN class="param">[ ]</SPAN></SPAN> Optional. If used with a specifier that works with
signed numbers, numbers outputted with no sign will have a space put before them.
<P>
<SPAN class="param">[#]</SPAN></SPAN> Optional. Octal numbers will be prefixed with a 0,
and hex numbers will be prefixed with a 0x. When used with flex specifiers, a decimal point
will always be outputted.
<P>
<SPAN class="param">[0]</SPAN></SPAN> Optional. When used, all of the width's digits to the left
of the number will be ouputted as zeros instead of being left blank.
<P>
<SPAN class="param">[width]</SPAN> Optional. This sets the minimum width for the concatenated
value. All of the value's significant digits will be outputted though this may exceed the width.
<P>
<SPAN class="param">[.size]</SPAN> Optional. For integer specifiers, this is the minimum size for the number. For
flex specifiers (other than %g), this is the number of decimal digits to output (default of six). Size digits unused by
the value will be outputted as zeros.
<P>
<SPAN class="param">[prefix]</SPAN> Optional. This is a specifier prefix used to modify the output
value type. These prefixes are of little use to Cog, because the concat verbs' parameters have set
types. Refer to the chart below.
<P>
<SPAN class="param">specifier</SPAN> This is the format specifier to use. The charts below
show which specifiers are used by integers and flexes.

<P>
Specifiers that are "unsigned" do not accept negative values. Using an unsigned specifier with a signed
value will cause the engine to output meaningless numbers.
<P>
These format specifiers are from Visual C++, they are not part of Cog. Cog is able to use them because
the concat verbs pass the string and argument to the VC++ engine. 
<P>
In doing that, format specifiers lose some of the their functionality because Cog cannot pass more than
those two arguments. The above description of the syntax and use of the specifiers has been somewhat
simplified because the excluded information doesn't apply to Cog's use of the specifiers.

<A name=concat><H4>Concatenation</H4></A>

To <EM>concatenate</EM> is to link together. In Cog, concatenation refers to linking values together into a string that is printed with
<A href="jkstringoutput.html">jkStringOutput()</A>. When you concatenate a value, JK adds it to the end of a stored string.
<A href="jkstringclear.html">jkStringClear()</A> clears the stored string for a new series of concatenations. Each computer has its
own concatenated string.
<P>
Here's an example of concat verbs in use:

<PRE class=code>
jkStringClear();
jkStringConcatAsciiString("The number of players in this game is: ");
jkStringConcatInt(GetNumPlayers());
jkStringOutput(-3, -1);
</PRE>

Notice in that example that <A href="jkstringclear.html">jkStringClear()</A> is run before the concatenation. Even after the string
has been outputted, it is still in memory. But because all concatenation code in cog clears the string before the concatenation,
this will not cause problems.

<A name=strings><H4>Strings</H4></A>

A <EM>string</EM>, in programming terms, is a collection of letters, numbers, and odd characters which is enclosed by quotation marks
when written. There is no string symbol type to store a string with, but JK does store one string for concatenation. Uni files store generic
strings. The two uni files that can be accessed by cog are jkstrings.uni and cogstrings.uni.
<P>
The jkstrings.uni holds strings that will be used during normal gameplay in any level. Strings like "Using Bacta" and "Fists" are
stored in this file. Cogstrings.uni is a level file that holds the strings that are to be used by an episode. "Locked!" and "This looks interesting!"
come from the cogstrings of <EM>The Force Within</EM>.
<P>
In both of these files, strings are defined like this: <SPAN class=exam>"COG_x" 0 "string"</SPAN> - where x is the number of the string. It is this number that cog verbs use
to locate the string. If you give a verb the number to a string that does not exist, you'll see "COG_yourNum" print on the screen.

<A name=dests><H4>Destinations</H4></A>

<TABLE class=small align=center width="100%" bgcolor=silver cellpadding=3 border=1>
<TR><TH colspan=4 class=big>Output Destinations</TH></TR>
<TR><TH width="30%">Destination</TH><TH class=left>Player that receives the message:</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>0, 1, 2, etc.</TD><TD class=left>If there's a player with the thingref of this dest, the message is sent to him. Otherwise, it's local.</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<A name=debug><H4>Debugging</H4></A>

The print verbs are the most useful tools for debugging. <A href="verb_print.html">Print()</A> can tell you if a message runs, and
<A href="printflex.html">PrintFlex()</A> can print variable values. When you have a problem with a cog, one of the first
things you should do is print something. The print verbs (not the concat verbs) were most likely created just for debugging purposes.
