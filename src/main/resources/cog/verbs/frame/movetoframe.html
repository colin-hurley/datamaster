<H2>MoveToFrame</H2><HR>
Makes a path-controlled object move to a frame position at the given speed. MoveToFrame() will
send the object to any "intermediate" frames on the path to the destination frame; read the rules below. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>MoveToFrame(object, frame, speed_flex);</CODE>
<P>
<B>An Example:</B>  Say you have the path-controlled object at frame 2 out of five. If you use MoveToFrame() to send
the object to the fifth frame, the object will go to the third, fourth, and then fifth frame.
<P>
<B>A Few Rules:</B>
<P>
If you send an object to a frame greater (in number) than the one it's on,<SUP>1</SUP> the object will move to any
intermediate frames greater than the one it's on and less than the destination frame before arriving at the destination.
<P>
If you send an object to the frame it's on, the object will go directly to frame 1 and then go through any intermediates to
reach its frame again.
<P>
If you send an object to a frame less than the one it's on, the object will pass through any frames less than the one it's on
and greater than the target frame as it travels to the destination.
<P>
Frame 0 is seperated from the rest. MoveToFrame() will not use it unless you send the object specifically to it. When you do this,
MoveToFrame() will send the object through any intermediate frames on the way to zero.
