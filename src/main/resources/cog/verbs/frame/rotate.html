Rotates a path-controlled object 360 degrees with the given direction and velocity. If a thing is given two rotate commands, they will contradict each other.
When the rotation is finished, the thing will be given an upright lookvector regardless of what it was before. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>Rotate(thing, rot_vel);</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>rot_vel:</SPAN> The rotation velocity is given in vector form. This vector gives the velocity and direction (pitch, yaw, roll)
of the rotation.
<P>
Rotate() sets the current frame of the path-controlled thing to -1 while the thing rotates. When the rotation is completed, the current
frame is set to 0 regardless of the frame that it was at.
