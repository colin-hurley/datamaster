<H2>Notes on Frame Verbs</H2><HR>
A path-controlled object moves along a set path. The points that mark the path are called frames. These frames are positions + orientations
that are set in the Things Section of a .jkl file. Objects can move from one frame to another instantly or at a given speed depending on what
verb is used.
<P>
An object's frames are defined in its entry in the Things Section of a level file. The parameter, <SPAN class=temp>numframes=x</SPAN>, specifies
the number of frames the object will have. The actual frames are defined with <SPAN class=temp>frame=(x/y/z:p/y/r)</SPAN> - where
<SPAN class=exam>x/y/z</SPAN> is the position and <SPAN class=exam>p/y/r</SPAN> is the pitch, yaw, and roll
that the object will have at that frame. The position is measured in JKUs, and the orientation in degrees.
