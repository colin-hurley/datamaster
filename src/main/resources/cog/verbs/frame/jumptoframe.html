<H2>JumpToFrame</H2><HR>
Makes a path-controlled object teleport to a frame position. Make the frame_sector the sector
that the new frame position is in - which is not always the sector that the object is currently in. The
<A href="../../message/arrived.html">arrived</A> message will not be called when the object is jumped.
<P>
JumpToFrame() puts the object at the frame position no matter if there's anything already there. With JumpToFrame(),
the object being moved cannot be blocked. 
<P>
This verb does not update the current frame when it jumps the object.
Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>JumpToFrame(object, frame_int, frame_sector);</CODE>
<P>
If you don't give JumpToFrame() the correct sector, you'll get errors like:
<UL>
<LI>Object has no lighting.
<LI>Object disappears.
<LI>Object has no collision.
</UL>
If the object to be jumped is paused with <A href="pathmovepause.html">PathMovePause()</A>, JumpToFrame() will jump the object, but it will still be paused.
<P>
