<A name="alignment"><H4 style="margin-top:0">AI Alignment</H4></A>

The alignment values used by the AI alignment verbs is the same alignment that is specified in an actor's AI definition file.
In MotS, the following values are used for alignment:
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="1" cellpadding="5">
<TR>
<TH>Alignment</TH>
<TH>Usage</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>-1.0</TD>
<TD>AI with this alignment are hostile toward the player (E.g. Imperials)</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>0.0</TD>
<TD>AI with this alignment are neutral and do not attack (E.g. Civilians)</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>1.0</TD>
<TD>AI with this alignment are allied with the player (E.g. Rebels)</TD>
</TR>

<A name="bubbles"><H4 style="margin-top:0">Bubbles</H4></A>

MotS introduces the ability to create bubbles.  A bubble is a spherical region around a thing that moves with the thing and
sends cog messages when the player enters (<A HREF="../../message/enterbubble.html">enterbubble</A>) or exits
(<A HREF="../../message/exitbubble.html">exitbubble</A>) the bubble region.
<P>
Bubbles are always created with <A HREF="jkcreatebubble.html">jkCreateBubble()</A>, but a thing's bubble can be destroyed by
either <A HREF="jkdestroybubble.html">jkDestroyBubble()</A> or some other event that removes the thing from the game.  A bubble
can be resized after creation with <A HREF="jksetbubbleradius.html">jkSetBubbleRadius()</A>.
<P>
Every bubble has a type associated with it.  A bubble's type is initially set at creation time by
jkCreateBubble(), but the type can later be changed for existing bubbles via
<A HREF="jksetbubbletype.html">jkSetBubbleType()</A>.  Although the verbs will accept negative values for the bubble type, not
all parts of the mechanism handle the negative values properly, so a non-negative integer should always be used for the
bubble type to avoid problematic behavior.
<P>
The <A HREF="jkgetfirstbubble.html">jkGetFirstBubble()</A> and <A HREF="jkgetnextbubble.html">jkGetNextBubble()</A> verbs
can be used to locate all bubbles that currently exist in the level.
