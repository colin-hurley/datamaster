<H2>jkGetNextBubble</H2><HR>
Returns the next thing in the level that has a bubble.  If there are no more things in the level that
have a bubble, jkGetNextBubble() will return -1.  Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>thing</SPAN>=<CODE>jkGetNextBubble();</CODE>
<P>
Cog stores the number of the last thing that <A HREF="jkGetFirstBubble.html">jkGetFirstBubble()</A> or
jkGetNextBubble() returned, so that the next time jkGetNextBubble() is called, it knows to find the next
thing in the level after the last returned thing.  When the cog calls jkGetFirstBubble(), the thing number
is set back to the first thing in the level with a bubble, thereby starting a new iteration and canceling
the previous iteration.
<P>
Note: Unlike other thing iteration verbs, jkGetNextBubble() can be called before (or without) calling
jkGetFirstBubble().  If the last returned thing is -1 or jkGetFirstBubble() was never called, calling
jkGetNextBubble() starts a new iteration as though jkGetFirstBubble() were called.  This means that you
can technically perform a complete iteration over all bubble things in the level using only jkGetNextBubble()
without making any calls to jkGetFirstBubble(); however, the best practice is to call jkGetFirstBubble()
first to ensure that the iteration always starts on the first bubble thing (E.g. in case another cog only
iterates partially through the list).
