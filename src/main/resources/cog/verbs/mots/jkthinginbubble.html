This verb was not used by LEC.  It is unknown what this verb does, what parameters it accepts, or if it works correctly.
<!--
The verb seems to take three parameters.
The third parameter seems to crash the game more readily than the first two (I.e. in a brute force test of f(0,0,0), ..., f(0,0,6), f(0,1,0), ..., etc.)
The game seems to hang whenever the verb is used in a variable assignment (I.e. x=f(...) ).
Using the string concat verbs to print the value displays -1, but that may be a result of not returning a value.
