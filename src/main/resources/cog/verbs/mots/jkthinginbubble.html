This verb was not used by LEC and does not seem to work correctly.
It may be intended to return the thing whose bubble contains the specified thing.
However, the verb crashes the game when the specified thing is in a bubble.
Otherwise, it returns -1.
Suggested syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>bubble_thing</SPAN>=<CODE>jkThingInBubble(thing);</CODE>
<P>
<BR><HR></BODY></HTML>
