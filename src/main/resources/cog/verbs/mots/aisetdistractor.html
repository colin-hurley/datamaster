Designates a thing to be a distraction for actors.  Actors will automatically target and attack the distraction.
To unset the distraction thing, use -1 as the distractor thing reference. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>AISetDistractor(distractor);</CODE>
<P>
It seems that actors that use the LookForOpposingTarget instinct do not automatically attack the distraction thing
unless they are already attacking some other target, although the exact required conditions for this behavior are
unclear.  If the actor is not attacking another target, he will ignore the distraction thing. One workaround for
this problem is to use an actor with an opposing <A HREF="notes.html#alignment">AI alignment</A> as the distraction
(E.g. for enamy actors with alignment -1.0, the distraction thing should be given alignment 1.0).
<P>
It should be noted that, in the unmodified MotS cogs, certain actions are programmed to unset the distraction
thing.  For example, when the player fires a weapon, the weapon cog will send a message to the player class cog,
which then unsets the distractor thing.
