Sets AI alignment for the player. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>effect_handle</SPAN>=<CODE>AIAddAlignmentPriority(alignment, priority);</CODE>
<P>
When an alignment is added with AIAddAlignmentPriority, the alignment change will stay in effect until
it is stopped with <A HREF="AIRemoveAlignmentPriority.html">AIRemoveAlignmentPriority</A>.
<P>
When multiple alignments with different priorities are set (in any order), the alignments with lower
priority will have no effect until the highest priority alignment is stopped.
<P>
When multiple alignments with the same priority are set, the first one that was set will have priority
over the others of the same priority until it is stopped.
