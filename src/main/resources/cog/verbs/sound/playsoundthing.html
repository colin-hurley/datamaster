Plays the sound at the position of a thing. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>channel</SPAN>=<CODE>PlaySoundThing(wav, thing, volume, minrad, maxrad, flags);</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>wav:</SPAN> This the wav file to play. This is usually a variable defined
in the symbols section, but you can also use <A href="../system/loadsound.html">LoadSound()</A>.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>thing:</SPAN> This is the thing that the sound will be played at. To make the
sound move with the thing, use the 0x80 <A href="../../../flags/sound/sound_frame.html" target="main">Sound Flag</A>.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>volume:</SPAN> This is the 0-1 flex volume.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>minrad:</SPAN> The minimum radius is the distance from the position at which the sound can
be heard at full volume.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>maxrad:</SPAN> The maximum radius is the distance from the position at which you
can hear the sound. The sound volume will be reduced as you move farther away from the position between the min
and max radii.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>flags:</SPAN> These are the <A href="../../../flags/sound/sound_frame.html" target="main">Sound Flags</A>
to play the sound with.
