<H2>Notes on Thing Mode Verbs</H2><HR>

All of the modes covered in this section have a mode and then a current mode. Remember to make a distinction between
the current mode and the mode.

<A name=geo><H4>Thing Geo Modes</H4></A>

The current <A href="../../../flags/geomode/geomode_frame.html" target="main">Geo Mode</A> of a thing is the value
that the thing will use. The Geo Mode seems to be simply a stored value for the thing. Setting the current Geo Mode
of a thing has no effect on the Geo Mode and setting the Geo Mode has no effect on the current Geo Mode. The default
Geo Mode and current Geo Mode for a thing is 4.

<A name=light><H4>Thing Light Modes</H4></A>

Setting the current <A href="../../../flags/lightmode/lightmode_frame.html" target="main">Light Mode</A> of a thing has
no effect on the thing or the Light Mode, and any new value is quickly overwritten. Setting the Light Mode of a thing
changes the thing, and after a very small delay, it changes the current Light Mode. Changing the Light Mode of the
player has no effect on the weapon mesh. The default Light Mode and current Light Mode for a thing is 3.

<A name=tex><H4>Thing Texture Modes</H4></A>

The thing tex mode verbs do change a thing's <A href="../../../flags/texmode/texmode_frame.html" target="main">Texture Mode</A>, but the
visual appearance of the thing is not changed. The engine does not seem to care what a thing's texture mode values are,
they will be rendered with perspective texturing regardless. Even when the advanced display options are used to change
the engine's overall texturing mode, things are rendered perspectively.
<P>
<A href="setthingtexmode.html">SetThingTexMode()</A> changes the <A href="../../../flags/texmode/texmode_frame.html" target="main">Tex Mode</A>,
and after a very short delay, it changes the current Tex Mode. Setting the current Tex Mode has no effect and the value
is quickly changed back. The default Tex Mode for a thing is 2, while the current Tex Mode has a default of 1.
