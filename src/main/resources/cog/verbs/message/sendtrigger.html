Sends a trigger to all cogs on one or more computers depending on the destination. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>SendTrigger(dest, ID, param0, param1, param2, param3);</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>dest:</SPAN> The destination controls which computers in the game the trigger
will be sent to. Read the table below for the destination values.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>ID:</SPAN> The ID of a trigger becomes the sourceref of the trigger message.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>paramX:</SPAN> These four parameters will become the four parameters of the trigger message.
<P>
You can't send triggers with a player thing destination in SP until an MP game has been played (without exiting JK inbetween).
Something done for multiplayer levels initializes JK's player array, and until that happens you can't send a trigger to a player
in SP. This is something you need to keep in mind for writing cogs to work in both MP and SP.
