<H2>Notes on Score Verbs</H2><HR>

<A name=system><H4 style="margin-top:0">Scoring System</H4></A>

Each player has four scoring values assigned to him: deaths, kills, suicides, and his overall score. 
<P>
<STRONG>When JK's scoring system is not disabled:</STRONG>
A player's score will be found by subtracting his suicides from his kills. When the scores
are refreshed (upon a player's death), the new score value will be used in place of his old score; the old score will be
discarded. In teamplay, all players in the team have their score added up for the team score. When a player dies, this team
score is recalculated, and the new team score is substituted for the old one.
<P>
<STRONG>When the scoring system is disabled:</STRONG>
<A href="../multiplayer/setmultimodeflags.html">SetMultiModeFlags(0x4)</A> is used to disable
JK's scoring for CTF games. When scoring is disabled, the JK engine does not calculate the
players' scores or team scores. Instead, cogs are used to set the overall scores of the players
and teams.
<P>
The engine does not allow client computers to change the scores - only the server can. And when
the server modifies a score, it will send the new scores to the clients.

<A name=limit><H4>Score Limits</H4></A>

When a player score exceeds the score limit, he should win and then the game should end. In normal gameplay that would
be fine, but with Cog verbs it's not. For the new score limit to be recognized by JK, the scores have to be refreshed -
a player has to die.
<P>
Say you set the score limit to 1. Then you used <A href="setplayerscore.html">SetPlayerScore()</A> to set the player's score to 5. The game would not end there -
the scores have not been refreshed. And when the player dies and the scores are refreshed, a new score will be
found and then substituted for the score you set. The player's new score might not be over the limit. Keep this in mind when working
with score limits.
