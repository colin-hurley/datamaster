<H2>VectorCross</H2><HR>
Two vectors that don't have the same direction<SUP>1</SUP> will form a plane. VectorCross() returns a vector
which is perpendicular to this plane. The length of the cross product is the sine of the angle between the vectors
multiplied by their lengths (see the math below). Syntax:

<H5>The Right Hand Rule</H5>
There are two directions that are perpendicular to a plane - right and left. The <EM>right hand rule</EM> determines
which direction the cross product will have.
<P>
<IMG src="../../../pics/handrule.jpg" align=left>
The direction of the cross product is determined by placing vector1 and vector2 tail-to-tail, flattening the right hand, extending
it in the direction of vector1,  and then curling the fingers in the direction that the angle vector1 makes with vector2. The thumb
then points in the direction of the cross product.

<SPAN class=math>crossvec=(y1*z2 - y2*z1, x2*z1 - x1*z2, x1*y2 - x2*y1);</SPAN>
<P>
The formula for the length of the cross product is: <SPAN class=math>sin&theta; * |v1| * |v2|</SPAN>.<BR>
Where &theta; is the angle between the vectors.<BR>
And |v1| is the length of vector1.<BR>
And |v2| is the length of vector2.

The green vector is the cross product of the red and blue vectors. Because the sine of 90 degrees is 1 and the red
and blue vectors have a length of one, the length of the cross product is one.
<P>
The right hand rule shows that the vector points upwards on the z axis and not in the negative direction.

<SUP>1</SUP>That is, the two vectors are not colinear. If they are, there will be no angle between them and the cross
product will be the zero vector.
