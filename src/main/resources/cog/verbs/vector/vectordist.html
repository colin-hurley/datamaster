<H2>VectorDist</H2><HR>
Finds the difference between two vectors and returns its length. Syntax:

<SPAN class=math>diff_len=sqrt(sqr(x1-x2) + sqr(y1-y2) + sqr(z1-z2));</SPAN>

When one vector is subtracted from another, the resultant vector becomes a line from the tip of one vector
to the other. The length of this line is the distance between the vectors.

VectorDist() uses the <EM>displacement</EM> of the vector from <NOBR>'0 0 0'</NOBR> to measure the distance between
vector1 and vector2. The operation is the same with positions; the difference is how you think of a position as opposed to a
displacement vector.
