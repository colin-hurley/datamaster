<H2>Notes on Vectors</H2><HR>
Vectors are no doubt the hardest thing to learn in Jedi Knight. They involve complex math that most people
aren't taught in school. The author makes an attempt with this reference to provide a simple way to visualize
vectors without having to learn too much math. But if you've studied physics or trigonometry, learning how to manipulate
vectors will be much easier.

<H4>A Vector</H4>

Simply put, a vector is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude. Acceleration, force, and velocity are vectors.
Not all vectors need the magnitude. These vectors are used for direction only and are called <EM>lookvectors</EM> in cog.
You can visualize vectors with arrows as in this example from <A href="vectoradd.html">VectorAdds()'s</A> description:
<P>
<IMG src="../../../pics/vectoradd2.gif" align=left style="margin-right:10">
Three vectors are shown in this diagram. The length of each vector's arrow is its magnitude. You can have
a vector with any number of dimensions. In this 2d picture, only two dimensions are used - x and y. In JK's
virtual world, a third dimesion - the z axis - is added to simulate the real world.
<BR clear=left>
<P>
A 3d vector is expressed as three numbers - (x, y, z). Each number holds the vector's value on that axis. Because
you can have vectors with different numbers of dimensions, you can't write all vectors as three numbers. The examples
in this reference will use three numbers for all vectors, and the z axis will be left at zero if it is not used.
<P>
The blue vector in the above diagram can be expressed as '1 -1 0'. That's plus one unit on the x axis and minus one unit
on the y axis. This gives the vector a direction of -45 degrees on the graph. The length of that vector is nearly 1.4.<SUP>1</SUP>
<P>
<IMG src="../../../pics/scaledblue.gif" align=left style="margin-right:10">
The length can be increased with no change in direction. This graph shows the blue vector from the above diagram.
The length has been increased to about 2.83, but the direction has not changed. The new vector is expressed as '-2 -2 0'.
<BR clear=left>
<P>
Because vectors can represent different quantities (positions, velocity, acceleration), their unit is not consistent. The length
of a velocity will be the speed of the velocity while the length of a position vector will be the JKU distance from the center of
the virtual world.

<H4>Vectors vs. Positions</H4>

This reference makes a distinction between vectors and positions. A vector is a direction and magnitude, and
a position is a point on a 3d map. Both are used for different things. But if you consider, positions
are really a type of vector.
<P>
<IMG src="../../../pics/vectoradd2.gif" align=left style="margin-right:10">
Look at this diagram of a vector again. The vectors' displacement is the point
at the end of the arrow.
<BR clear=left>
<P>
<IMG src="../../../pics/position.gif" align=left style="margin-right:10">
These dots represent positions in the virtual world. They are expressed the same as the vectors in the above diagram.
The '0 0 0' on the graph is the center of the world. If you imagine a line from <NOBR>'0 0 0'</NOBR> to any of the positions
on this map, you'll have drawn one of the vectors from the graph above.
<BR clear=left>
<P>
As you can see in those examples, positions are the same as displacement vectors. But remember this is only one
type of vector. A position is a vector, but a vector is not always a position.

<H4>Written Vectors</H4>

In Cog, Jedi Knight allows vectors to be given in two ways. First, you can have a variable of type vector. For example:
<P>
<CODE>lvec=GetThingLook(player);</CODE>
<P>
The variable, lvec, now holds the vector direction that the player is looking. You can use this variable in any
vector parameter. For example:
<P>
<CODE>SetThingLook(some_thing, lvec);</CODE>
<P>
some_thing will be set to look in the direction held by lvec. The other way to write a vector is in this form: 'x y z'.
You can use this anywhere a vector is called for. EG:
<P>
<CODE>lvec='1 0 0';</CODE>
<P>
Or,
<P>
<CODE>SetThingLook(player, '1 0 0');</CODE>
<P>
In that last example, the player was set to look straight down the x axis.

<A name=sincos><H4>Sine, Cosine, and Quadrants</H4></A>

These are things you really should learn in Mathmatics. But I'll explain the stuff here anyway. These concepts are only needed for
<A href="vectordot.html">VectorDot()</A> and <A href="vectorcross.html">VectorCross()</A>, so it's not a big deal if you skip this.
<P>
<IMG src="../../../pics/vectordot.gif" align=left style="margin-right:10; margin-bottom:40">
Two vectors form an angle and a plane.
<P>
This picture from VectorDot()'s description shows two vectors and the angle between them.
Note that the angle starts at the +x black line and extends into the second quadrant(see below).
Angles always start at the positive x line. Angles can extend positively or negatively. In this case,
the angle is +120, but the same angle could be written as -240.
<P>
Notice that these two vectors form a 2d plane. No matter which way the vectors point, they will always
form a plane.
<BR clear=left>
<P>
<IMG src="../../../pics/quadrant.gif" align=left style="margin-right:10">
There are four quadrants on a graph. The results of the cosine and sine functions are negative
in some quadrants and positive in others. In the above example, the dot product was negative
because the angle ended in the second quadrant - in which cosine is negative.
<BR clear=left>
<P>
Fully explaining sine and cosine is beyond the scope of this reference (and probably the author). So only the
results of sine and cosine operations will be explained.
<P>
<IMG src="../../../pics/sine.gif" align=left style="margin-right:10">
Sine returns a number from 0 to 1. The closer the end of the angle is to the y axis, the closer the returned number will
be to 1. As the VectorDot() picture shows, vector1 is placed on the positive side of the x axis. Wherever vector2 points
will be the end of the angle formed between the vectors. As the quadrant diagram shows, sine is negative in quadrants
3 and 4.
<BR clear=left>
<P>
<A name=cosine><IMG src="../../../pics/cosine.gif" align=left style="margin-right:10"></A>
The closer the end of the angle is to the x axis, the higher the cosine will be. As shown in the quadrant graph, cosine
is negative in the second and third quadrants.
<BR clear=left>

<A name=scalars><H4>Vectors and Scalars</H4></A>

Scalars<SUP>2</SUP> are quantities that have only magnitude - no direction. Scalars include time, mass, and speed. You can use
physics formulas like f=ma with vectors. Scale an acceleration vector by a mass and you will get a force vector. Here are some
other formulas to use:
