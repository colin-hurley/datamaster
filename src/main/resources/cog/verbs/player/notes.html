<H2>Notes on Player Verbs</H2><HR>

<A name=index><H4 style="margin-top:0">Player Index</H4></A>

All players in a game, whether SP or MP, have an <EM>index number</EM>. The following table
shows how index numbers are assigned.
<P>
<TABLE class=small align=center width="50%" bgcolor=silver cellpadding=3 border=1>
<TR><TH colspan=4>Index Number Assignment</TH></TR>
<TR><TH width="30%">Number</TH><TH width=*>Player</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>0</TD><TD class=left>Host or SP player.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1</TD><TD class=left>First player to join.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2</TD><TD class=left>Second joiner</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3</TD><TD class=left>Third joiner</TD></TR>

</TABLE>
<P>
<A href="getplayernum.html">GetPlayerNum()</A> takes the player's thing number and returns his index number.
<A href="getplayerthing.html">GetPlayerThing()</A> takes the index number and returns the thing number of a player.

<A name=align><H4>Player's Alignment</H4></A>

Until the SP player reaches a level of type DECIDE in an episode, he won't have made the choice between
the light and dark sides. When the player reaches the decision screen, the engine looks at the
player's alignment bin (#75) to determine if the player has been good or bad in the levels.
<P>
If the player has been bad (killed a lot of civvies and chosen dark powers), he will be "seduced by the dark side"
and go the the appropriate dark side levels (as defined in the episode.jk of the episode).
<P>
If the player has been good to civvies and chosen light powers, he'll go to the light side - and play the light side
levels. <A href="jkgetchoice.html">jkGetChoice()</A> returns 0 before the DECIDE level, and afterwards returns 1 if the player joins the light side,
or 2 if he joins the dark side.
<P>
When a pedestrian is created in the game, bin 73 (peds_total) is upped one. And when one
of these peds dies, bin 72 (peds_killed) is incremented. Now when the player finishes the level,
the engine calculates the player's alignment based on total peds and peds killed. The engine then stores
this alignment value in bin 75.
<P>
If the alignment is positive, the player favors the light side; if the alignment
value is negative the player favors the dark side. This alignment value is what the engine looks at
when the player reaches the decision screen (the DECIDE level).

<A name=goals><H4>Goals and their Flags</H4></A>

Goals, also called objectives, serve no purpose in gameplay except to be displayed in the objectives
window. The verbs that manipulate these goals are <A href="setgoalflags.html">SetGoalFlags()</A>
and <A href="cleargoalflags.html">ClearGoalFlags()</A>. Each goal can have <A href="../../../flags/goal.html" target="main">Goal Flags</A>
assigned to it which tell the engine how to display the goal. Goals numbers start at zero, so the first
goal has a number of 0 and is called goal 0.
<P>
In the Episode's .gob file, there is a misc folder that contains cogstrings.uni. Among other things, cogstrings
contains the text to be displayed for each level's goals. A typical goal description in cogstrings looks like this:
<P>
<PRE class=exam>"GOAL_01000"  0  "Find 8t88 before he escapes with your father's data disc."   # Goal 0</PRE>
<P>
Goals numbers must begin at the string offset of a level - it is 1000 in the example. By convention, the first level in an Episode
has a string offset of 1000, the second level has 2000, the third 3000, etc. If there were another goal in the above example,
it would have a number of 1001, and the next goal would have 1002, and so on. Remember to update the message count
at the top of cogstrings when you add new goals.
<P>
The string offset of a level is stored in bin 99 of the items.dat. So you would use SetInv(player, 99, 1000); to set
the string offset for the first level.
<P>
You may wonder why the GoalFlags verbs have the player as a parameter. At first, it seems that goals belong
more to the level than the player. But the truth is that the GoalFlags verbs are only setting inventory bins.
They need the player's number to access his inventory. Bins 100 to 115 contain the flags that the goals
are to be displayed with. And yes, you can use regular inventory verbs (like <A href="../inventory/setinv.html">SetInv()</A>) with these bins. Just
remember that you're working with hexadecimal numbers.
<P>
Note that there is no way to retrieve the Goal Flags of a goal with the GoalFlags verbs. But you can use <A href="../inventory/getinv.html">GetInv()</A>
to retrieve these flags:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>flags</SPAN>=<CODE>GetInv(player, 100 + goal_num);</CODE>

<A name=handle><H4>A Handle on the Player</H4></A>

A handle, in editing terms, is the number of something (just about everything is numbered). In SP, it's simple to get
a handle on the player; use <A href="getlocalplayerthing.html">GetLocalPlayerThing()</A> or
or <A href="getplayerthing.html">GetPlayerThing(0)</A>. But in multiplayer, when there's more than one player, the problem becomes more difficult.
Remember that GetLocalPlayerThing(), when run on different machines, will return the different local players; this is often forgotten and is a common
multiplayer bug.
<P>
To get the value of the player that you want, you'll have to decide how he relates to the situation. Here's a few examples:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Suppose that a player has fired a raildet. And you need to find who fired it in the created message of the raildet's template cog
(which is 00_smoketrail). Of course, GetLocalPlayerThing() will not work. And there's no sourceref for the created message.
<P>
But because the player who fired the raildet will be its <A href="../thingprop/notes.html#parent">parent</A>, you can use
<A href="../thingprop/getthingparent.html">GetThingParent(raildet)</A> to return the player who fired the raildet (the sender
of created will be the raildet).
<P>
<LI>In another case, suppose you need to get the thing number of the host. GetPlayerThing() is very handy for this purpose.
Simply use GetPlayerThing(0) to return the thing number of the host.
<P>
<LI>Say you need to find which player activated a hotkey in the activated message of the hotkey's cog. Now because the local
player must have activated the hotkey (you can't activate other people's hotkeys over the 'net), you can use GetLocalPlayerThing()
to return the player who pressed the hotkey. The soureref of activated is also the player who pressed the key.
</UL>
<P>
One of the most common mistakes new editors make is to assume that <A href="../message/getsourceref.html">GetSourceRef()</A>
returns the value of a player. The sourceref is a property of a message. GetSourceRef() will return different things depending in what
message it was run. The message descriptions list the source and sender of each message.
