<H2>GetLocalPlayerThing</H2><HR>
Returns the thing number of the local player. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>player</SPAN>=<CODE>GetLocalPlayerThing();</CODE>
<P>
It's been said that GetLocalPlayerThing(), jkGetLocalPlayer(), or both have problems in MP with returning
the correct player - these verbs allegedly returned only the host player's thing number. Testing does not
confirm this, and the problem with these verbs is probably the fault of users not understanding how
their cogs were acting in MP.
<P>
