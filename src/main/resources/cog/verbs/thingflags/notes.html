<H2>Notes on a Thing's Flags</H2><HR>
This section contains the flag verbs that are used to add, remove, and return a thing's flags. Little description for each
flag verb is given because most of the information that would be provided does not apply to the verb itself but
rather to the class of flags. So read the notes here for the information.

<A name=thing><H4>Thing Flags</H4></A>

Every type of thing can have <A href="../../../flags/thing/thing_frame.html" target="main">Thing Flags</A>. These flags can
be set in the thing's template with <SPAN class=temp>thingflags=0x</SPAN>. Or you can set them through cog with
<A href="setthingflags.html">SetThingFlags()</A>. These flags control basic options that pertain to things in general.

<A name=phys><H4>Physics Flags</H4></A>

You can set a thing's <A href="../../../flags/physics/physics_frame.html" target="main">Physics Flags</A> in its template
with <SPAN class=temp>physflags=0x</SPAN>, or you can set them with <A href="setphysicsflags.html">SetPhysicsFlags()</A>.
Physics Flags control how a thing moves in JK's 3d environment.

<A name=type><H4>Type Flags</H4></A>

Some thing types have their own set of typeflags. These are set in a thing's template with <SPAN class=temp>typeflags=0x</SPAN>
by Cog after the thing has been created. Perhaps for readability, LEC made a different verb for each type of thing to set the
typeflags. But all verbs that set a thing's typeflags have the same effect and are interchangeable.
<P>
Here's a list of links to the typeflags in the Flags Section:

<A href="../../../flags/actor/actor_frame.html" target=main>Actor Flags</A><BR>
<A href="../../../flags/explosion/explosion_frame.html" target=main>Explosion Flags</A><BR>
<A href="../../../flags/item/item_frame.html" target=main>Item Flags</A><BR>
<A href="../../../flags/particle/particle_frame.html" target=main>Particle Flags</A><BR>
<A href="../../../flags/weapon/weapon_frame.html" target=main>Weapon Flags</A>

<A name=attach><H4>Attach Flags</H4></A>

<A href="../../../flags/attach/attach_frame.html" target="main">Attach Flags</A> are set when a thing is attached to an object. The base
thing or surface of the attachment need not have any Attach Flags. Only the attached thing will have these flags. The
attached thing will have different flags depending on the type of attachment.
<P>
For more information on attachments, read the <A href="../thingact/attachment.html">Attachment</A> document in the Thing Action section.
