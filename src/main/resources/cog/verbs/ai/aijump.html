<H2>AIJump</H2><HR>
Makes an actor jump towards a position. If the actor does not reach the position
with his jump, he will walk the rest of the way. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=code>AIJump(actor, pos_vector, jumpspeed_multiplier);</SPAN>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>pos_vector:</SPAN> This is the position that you want to make an actor jump to.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>jumpspeed_multiplier:</SPAN> This flex will be multiplied by the actor's jumpspeed template setting, and
the result will be the speed the actor jumps with.
<P>
Although this verb will work regardless of an actor's puppet, you must have a jump keyframe listed in
the actor's puppet file to make him jump correctly. Without this key, the actor will be rammed into the ceiling. You do not
need to have any special instincts (such as jump) in the actor's ai file.
<P>
