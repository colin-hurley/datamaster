<H2>AutoSaveGame</H2><HR>
Makes an autosave of the game. An autosave is essentially the same as a quicksave, but it cannot
be loaded in the Load Game menu. When the player dies, the autosave will be loaded unless the player makes a quicksave after the autosave.
<P>
This verb is usually used after cutscenes so that you don't have to watch them again when you die. An autosave will be
discarded after you exit the level you made it in. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>AutoSaveGame();</CODE>
