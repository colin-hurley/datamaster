<A name=hor-ceil><H4 style="margin-top:0">Horizon & Ceiling</H4></A>

There are two types of sky used in JK: Horizon and Ceiling. The difference between them is that the horizon scrolls when the player walks
and turns and the ceiling scrolls only when he walks.

<A name=dispoffset><H4>Display Offsets</H4></A>

Both types of Sky have offsets and display distances. The offset is the horizontal and vertical distance from the 0,0 position. Notice that
the offset is 2d and has no z axis. However, when this offset is returned, it will be given a z axis of 0 - probably so it can be handled as
a vector. Horizon and Ceiling offsets are defined seperately in the level's header.
<P>
There are verbs designed to set these offsets, but they do not appear to work correctly.

<A name=dispdist><H4>Display Distances</H4></A>

The display distance is how far away the Sky is to be displayed. The Horizon's display distance is defined in the header with <SPAN class=exam>
Horizon Distance x</SPAN> where x is the flex distance. The normal distance setting for Horizon is 100. The Ceiling's display
distance is set with <SPAN class=exam>Ceiling Sky Z  x</SPAN> where x is the flex distance. The normal distance is 15.
Note that these display distances are not returned as the z axis of the offset.

<A name=grav><H4>Gravity</H4></A>

Basically, the gravity of a level controls how quickly things fall. The usual gravity for a level is 4.0. A gravity of zero won't make
anything fall. For example, when the player jumps, he won't come down; he'll just glide up for a while. But if you double the gravity, a player
can only jump half as high as normal and will come down more quickly.

<A name=time><H4>Time Verbs</H4></A>

LEC made several verbs to return the time spent in JK. From the verbs' names, it seems that LEC meant that <A href="getleveltime.html">GetLevelTime()</A>
should return the time spent playing a level while <A href="getgametime.html">GetGameTime()</A> and <A href="getflexgametime.html">GetFlexGameTime()</A>
should return the overall time spent in an episode. However, all three verbs only return the time spent in the current level.
