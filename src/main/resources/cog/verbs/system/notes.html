<H2>Notes on System Verbs</H2><HR>
<A name=bit><H4 style="margin-top:0">Bitwise Verbs</H4></A>

The Bitwise verbs are useful when you want to use hex numbers as flags. You can
use the <A href="../../operator/operators.html#bitwise" target="main">Bitwise Operator</A>
'&' instead of <A href="bittest.html">BitTest()</A>.

<A name=master><H4>Master Cogs</H4></A>

A cog can be designated as the master cog so that other cogs in the game can use <A href="getmastercog.html">GetMasterCog()</A> to
reference it. These other cogs would use a command like <A href="../message/sendmessage.html">SendMessage(GetMasterCog(), user0);</A>
to send a message to the master. Endlevel and startup cogs are usually made the master so they can easily receive messages from other cogs
in the level.

<A name=load><H4>Load Resource Verbs</H4></A>

The LoadRes verbs allow you to get a reference to sounds, models, keyframes, and templates without using the symbols section.
There is no known difference between a resource loaded with the symbols and a resource loaded by the LoadRes verbs. They will
both work the same. But with these verbs, you do not have to define an intermediate variable. So instead of:
<PRE class=code>
temp=LoadTemplate("shieldrecharge");
CreateThing(temp, player);
</PRE>
You can use:
<PRE class=code>
CreateThing(LoadTemplate("shieldrecharge"), player);
</PRE>

<A name=heap><H4>Heap Verbs</H4></A>

The heap verbs are used to dynamically create storage for variable values. You don't often need to do this in cog, but it is useful
when you don't know exactly how many values that you'll have to store. Unfortunatly, the heap verbs cannot be used to create
global variables - each cog works with its own heap, and no other cog can access it.
<P>
Let's say that you want to create five storage slots in memory. You would use <A href="heapnew.html">HeapNew(5)</A> to create
the five new slots. Imagine that it looks like this:
<P>
<CENTER><IMG style="border:thick double gray" src="../../../pics/heap.gif"></IMG></CENTER>
<P>
The last memory slot in the heap is slot 4. The five memory slots that we created range from 0 to 4.
<P>
In advanced programming languages, special "pointer" variables are used to store memory addresses. These variables point
to a location in memory. But in Cog, it is not so complicated. Pointers are regular integers which hold the value
of a slot number. However, these integers will still be called pointers in this reference.
<P>
None of the slots have a value until you use <A href="heapset.html">HeapSet(pointer, value)</A> to assign a value to one of
the slots. If you try to use <A href="heapget.html">HeapGet()</A> to return the value of a slot before it has been assigned a
value, JK will crash (or if there is no heap, it will return zero). This next diagram shows the result of HeapSet(0, 999):
<P>
<CENTER><IMG style="border:thick double gray" src="../../../pics/heapval.gif"></IMG></CENTER>
<P>
Now, the value 999 is stored in the first memory slot. To retrieve it, use <A href="heapget.html">HeapGet(0)</A>.
<P>
Suppose that you need to erase the heap's memory slots. You would use <A href="heapfree.html">HeapFree()</A>. This verb
will remove all of the storage space that JK has allotted for the cog. A cog's heap is not affected by
<A href="reset.html">Reset()</A>.
