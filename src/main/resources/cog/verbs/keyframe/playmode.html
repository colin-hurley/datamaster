Plays an animation that is listed in a thing's puppet. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>animID</SPAN>=<CODE>PlayMode(thing, submode);</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>thing:</SPAN> This is the thing that the animation will be played with.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>submode:</SPAN> This is the number of the submode to play in the thing's puppet file.
Puppet keys are not listed in order of their submode number, and most of the comments identifying submode numbers in .pup files are unreliable.
Refer to the <A href="submodes.html">Submode Listing</A> document for a list of submode numbers and their corresponding actions.
<P>
