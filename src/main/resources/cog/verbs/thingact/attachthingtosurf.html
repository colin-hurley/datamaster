This is a seemingly outdated verb to attach a thing to a surface. AttachThingToSurf()
is able to attach a thing to a floor surface and add the 0x1 <A href="../../../flags/attach/attach_frame.html" target=main>
Attach Flag</A>. But it does not work with other surfaces, and it is far easier
to use the 0x40 Physics Flag instead. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>AttachThingToSurf(thing, surface);</CODE>
<P>
AttachThingToSurf() sometimes tries to make the thing move to the z axis
of the surface - either by a small distance or gradually.
