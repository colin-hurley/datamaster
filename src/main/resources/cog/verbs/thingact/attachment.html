<H2>Notes on Attachment</H2><HR>

<H4 style="margin-top:0">Attachment</H4>

An attachment is the fixation of one thing to another. In any attachment, there is the attached thing and the thing or surface
that it is attached to - the base of the attachment. An attached thing does not have to be at the same position as the thing
or surface that it's attached to. Any thing's attachment will be broken if a force greater than half of its mass is applied to it.
<P>
The differrent types of attachments use their own <A href="../../../flags/attach/attach_frame.html" target="main">Attach Flag</A>.
Each of the four known types of attachments is described below.

<H4>0x1 Attachment</H4>

The 0x1 attachment is the most common. The JK engine uses it to attach things to surfaces.
<A href="attachthingtosurf.html">AttachThingToSurf()</A> also sets this flag. In the 0x1 attachment,
the attached thing is allowed to move around freely even while it is attached.

<H4>0x4 Attachment</H4>

In a 0x4 attachment, the attached thing copies the movements of the base thing. The attached thing cannot move by itself. The base thing
of the attachment cannot move if the attached thing cannot move - such as when it's backed up against a wall.
<P>
The 0x4 attachment has two major shortcomings. First, the attachment is broken when the attached thing enters a water sector. And second,
when a thing moves into a wall, it is in fact moving. So if the attached thing is being pushed into a wall it will move into the wall and be set back
very quickly. But JK counts this wall-pushing as movement and allows the base thing to move. This and other collision problems allow the attached
thing's original offset from the player to be distorted and the purpose of the attachment may be ruined.

<H4>0x6 Attachments</H4>

The 0x6 <A href="../../../flags/attach/attach_frame.html" target="main">Attach Flag</A> is a combination of 0x4 and 0x2 and is usually created with
<A href="attachthingtothingex.html">AttachThingToThingEx()</A>. With this attachment, the physics of the attached thing are ignored. The lookvector
of the attached thing is set to the lookvector of the base. Even with this attachment, wall-pushing is a problem. The base thing can move into a wall
and the "movement" will be transferred to the attached thing which is not restricted by the wall. However, because the physics of the attached thing
are not used, the attachment will not be broken when the thing enters water.
<P>
But, the big problem with this attachment is that it is unstable.

<H4>0xC Attachment</H4>

The 0xC <A href="../../../flags/attach/attach_frame.html" target="main">Attach Flag</A> is formed by the combination of the 0x4 and 0x8
Attach Flags. With 0xC attachments, the events and physics of the attached thing are ignored.
<P>
The events of the attached thing will mirror the events of the base. For example, the attached thing's splash message will run when
the base enters/exits a water sector, regardless of where the attached thing is.
<P>
Generally, the 0xC attachment should be used with things that should stay at the exact position of the base thing. In some ways, the
0x8 attachment is an improvement on the 0x4 attachment, because the attached thing doesn't drift away from collision problems.
