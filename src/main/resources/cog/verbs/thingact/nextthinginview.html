Returns the thing in view that has the next lowest thing number. <A href="firstthinginview.html">FirstThingInView()</A> must run before NTIV()
to set the FOV and mask settings. If FTIV() was not run first, NTIV() will return -1. NTIV() will also return -1 when the last thing returned was
the thing with the lowest thing number that was visible - at that point, there are no more valid things to return. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>thing</SPAN>=<CODE>NextThingInView();</CODE>
<P>
Cog stores the number of the last thing that FTIV() or NTIV() returned. So that the next time NTIV() runs, it knows to find the thing
with a thing number lower than the last thing returned. When the cog runs an FTIV() command, the thing number is set back to the
highest-numbered thing visible.
