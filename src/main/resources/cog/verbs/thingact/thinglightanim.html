<H2>ThingLightAnim</H2><HR>
Animates a thing's lighting. When the animation begins, the thing's light will be set to the min_light. Then the thing's light will
gradually change to the max_light during the fade_time. When the light reaches the maximum, it returns to the minimum and
continues the cycle. Use <A href="../animcel/stopanim.html">StopAnim()</A> to stop Thing Light Animations. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>animID</SPAN>=<CODE>ThingLightAnim(thing, min_light, max_light, fade_time);</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>min_light:</SPAN> This is the minimum light that the thing will have during the animation.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>max_light:</SPAN> This is the maximum light that the thing will have.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>fade_time:</SPAN> This is the time in seconds that it takes for the light to fade from one light value to the other.
<P>
This verb is similar to <A href="../animcel/surfacelightanim.html">SurfaceLightAnim()</A>, but ThingLightAnim() does
repeat while SurfaceLightAnim() does not.
