Damages a thing. Remember that the damaged message in the thing's class and capture cogs may change the damage amount. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>undamage</SPAN>=<CODE>DamageThing(thing, damage, flags, damager);</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=return>undamage:</SPAN> This is the amount of damage that was not applied to the thing.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>damage:</SPAN> This is the amout of health to subtract from the thing. This becomes the first parameter
of the damaged message.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>flags:</SPAN> This is the <A href="../../../flags/damage/damage_frame.html" target="main">Damage Flag</A> for the damage. This
tells the engine and the damaged message the type of the damage. This flag becomes the second parameter of the damaged message.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>damager:</SPAN> This is the thing that caused the damage. This thing becomes the source of the damaged
message.
<HR>
<P>
Aside from the class and capture cogs, the 0x10 <A href="../../../flags/inventory/inventory_frame.html" target="main">Inventory Flag</A> will make the local
player's damaged message run in an items.dat cog.
