If you're not using a regular actor or player, here's how to find out what the joint number is: open up the puppet of your thing
and scroll down to the bottom. There should be a section called <EM>joints</EM>. You'll see each joint number assigned to one
of the 3do's heirarchy nodes.
<P>
There may be a comment beside the joint number to tell you what that node is for. If there's not, open the 3do of the thing with
a text editor and scroll to the bottom. You'll see a list of heirarchy nodes. Look under the <EM>hnodename</EM> category and you'll
see the specific mesh of the 3do that the node is assigned to.
<P>
The name of the mesh should explain what part of the 3do it is. If not, you could open the model with a 3do editor.
