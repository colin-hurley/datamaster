ParseArg() provides a way to reset a thing's template settings through Cog. This is very useful for template settings
that don't have a cog verb designed specifically to change them. But use ParseArg() sparingly because it can
crash the game if used improperly, and its effect will not be synced. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>ParseArg(thing, "setting=x");</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>"setting=x"</SPAN> Set the template setting with ParseArg() the same as you would in the actual template.
Note that you can't use variables for the setting's value.
