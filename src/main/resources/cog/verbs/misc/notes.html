<A name=saber><H4 style="margin-top:0">The Lightsaber Effect</H4></A>

The lightsaber is a special weapon that is managed by several Cog verbs and
<A href="../../../flags/jk/jk_frame.html" target="main">Jedi Knight Flags</A>.
<A href="jksetsaberinfo.html">jkSetSaberInfo()</A> can be used to adjust the visual
settings of the lightsaber, but this verb does not have to be used normally because JK
will use default settings.
<P>
The 0x4 <A href="../../../flags/jk/jk_frame.html" target="main">Jedi Knight Flag</A> ignites
the saber, and the 0x1 flag tells the engine that the creature has
a saber. <A href="jkenablesaber.html">jkEnableSaber()</A> allows the saber to damage
things, but does not allow the saber to collide. The saber will not collide until the 0x2
flag is assigned to the creature. This 0x2 flag is normally assigned while the saber fire
keyframes are played.<SUP>1</SUP>
<P>
After the saber is swung, <A href="jkdisablesaber.html">jkDisableSaber()</A> prevents
the saber from damaging. And when the saber is deselected, the 0x8 flag turns off
the saber and then clears the 0x1 flag and itself.
<P>
Note that the saber can damage a creature once for every time the 0x2 flag is set.

<A name=reticle><H4>Targeting Reticle</H4></A>

The targeting reticle is composed of the three rings that expand and contract around a point.
It is used to select targets for force powers.
<P>
<A href="jksettargetcolors.html">jkSetTargetColors()</A> sets the color to be used by each
ring, <A href="jksettarget.html">jkSetTarget()</A> puts the reticle on a thing, and
<A href="jkendtarget.html">jkEndTarget()</A> removes the reticle. You cannot have more
than one targeting reticle in the game simultaneously.
<P>
<HR>
<SUP>1</SUP>Saber fire anims have special keyframe markers that tell the engine
which frames assign and clear the 0x2 <A href="../../../flags/jk/jk_frame.html" target="main">Jedi Knight Flag</A>.
