<A name=crash><H4 style="margin-top:0">Crashing</H4></A>
One of the most common things that crashes JK is when the object of focus for a camera is removed
from the game. Keep in mind that you can reset the camera with the removed message in a thing's cog.
So if you set a camera to watch a projectile, you can safely set the camera back to the player when
the <A href="../../message/removed.html">removed</A> message is called and not have to worry about instability or crashing.
<P>
Also, JK will only crash if you are using the view that no longer has an object. If you set the internal
camera to watch an object that is about to be removed and you are using the external camera, JK will
not crash when the object is removed. But switch to internal, and JK crashes.
