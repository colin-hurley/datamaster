<H2>SetPOVShake</H2><HR>
Changes the angle and position of the internal camera and then resets them. LEC used this
in their weapon cogs to simulate kickback. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE><NOBR>SetPOVShake(pos_offset, angle_offset, pos_reset_speed, angle_reset_speed);</NOBR></CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>pos_offset:</SPAN> This is an offset vector that moves the POV camera away from the original
camera position. Offset vectors like this one are usually written in this form: <SPAN class=exam>'x y z'</SPAN>.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>angle_offset:</SPAN> This offset vector changes the pitch, yaw, and roll of the view. It is usually written as
<SPAN class=exam>'p y r'</SPAN>, but you can use a vector variable instead.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>pos_reset_speed:</SPAN> This is the speed with which the camera returns to its original position.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>angle_reset_speed:</SPAN> This is the speed with which the camera returns to its original angle.

Here's how SetPOVShake() is used in weap_bryar.cog:
<BLOCKQUOTE><SPAN class=code>SetPOVShake('0.0 -.003 0.0', '1.0 0.0 0.0', .05, 80.0);</SPAN></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>

SetPOVShake() is used to reset the position and angle of the internal camera. If the reset speeds are zero, the camera's position and
angle will not be reset. This can be very useful if you want to change the view of the internal camera. The downside is that you cannot
see external-only models (like the player) and the internal weapon model will stay with the camera.
