<H2>Notes on Sector Verbs</H2><HR>

<A name=cmp><H4 STYLE="margin-top:0">Colormaps</H4></A>

8-bit textures use a pallete to define each of the 256 colors that they use. In JK, these palletes
are called "colormaps." 16, 24, and 32-bit textures do not use palletes.
<P>
In most colormaps, the first 192 colors are about the same (there are exceptions). But the last 64 colors vary from
one colormap to another. In the default colormap (dflt.cmp), these last 64 colors are a garish purple. When
you see a texture that has these ugly purple colors in it, it's probably because the default cmp, and not the
correct one for the texture, is being used.
<P>
Apparently, LEC's level editor - known as LEIA - did not save the level's colormaps in order. So the LEC programmers
did not know what the number of a colormap would be. When they needed a reference to a colormap for <EM>The Challenge
at Narshaada</EM>, they created a sector that used the colormap that was needed. Here's a modified example
from c3_fanpuzzle.cog:
<P>
<CODE>SetColorMap(signal_sc_sector, GetColorMap(red_colormap_sector));</CODE>
<P>
The colormaps that come with JK have a lot of the same colors (the first 192). If you change the cmp of a sector and notice
no change, it's because the new cmp didn't change the colors that the sector was using.

<A name=thrust><H4>Sector Thrusts</H4></A>

A <EM>sector thrust</EM> is a force that is applied to all moveable things in a sector. A thing must move by physics
(as opposed to path movement) and not have any inhibiting <A href="../../../flags/physics/physics_frame.html" target="main">Physics Flags</A>
for the thrust to work on it. Also, sector thrusts won't work on a creature if it's standing on a floor, because the creature is
attached to the surface it stands on.
<P>
When a sector thrust is created by <A href="setsectorthrust.html">SetSectorThrust()</A> the 0x8
<A href="../../../flags/sector/sector_frame.html" target="main">Sector Flag</A> is assigned to the sector. This flag
means the sector is using thrust. If you clear this flag with <A href="clearsectorflags.html">ClearSectorFlags()</A>,
the thrust will no longer be applied. But, the sector still has the thrust assigned to it. Give the sector the 0x8 flag again,
and the thrust will resume.

<A name=adjoin><H4>Sector Adjoins</H4></A>

<A href="setsectoradjoins.html">SetSectorAdjoins()</A> supposedly "turns off" the adjoins of a sector.
The apparent results are that rendering through the sector's adjoins is disabled and things cannot see
through the adjoins. Instead of seeing into the next sector, you'll see a hall of mirrors (HOM).
<P>
In certain cases, you will want to disable this rendering to improve your framerate. The most common example
is a door. When a door is closed, you don't need to see through into the sector beyond it. So, rendering through
the door's sector is disabled. If you do not disable it, then JK will still try to look into the next sector even though
the door is in the way; this will bring down your framerate.<SUP>1</SUP>
<P>
When the rendering is disabled in a sector, the 0x80 <A href="../../../flags/sector/sector_frame.html" target="main">Sector Flag</A>
is assigned to the sector. It appears that this flag's only purpose is to show that the adjoins are disabled, but there
may be more to it. The 0x1 <A href="../../../flags/surfaceadjoin/surfaceadjoin_frame.html" target="main">Surface Adjoin Flag</A> is removed
from all adjoins in the sector. Also, a strange 0x20 Surface Adjoin Flag is added to the adjoin; it is unknown what
purpose this flag serves.

<A name=tint><H4>Sector Tints</H4></A>

Sector tints are color effects that begin when the camera enters the sector. The actual camera position, and not the
position of the object the camera is looking at, has to enter the sector before the tint begins; this is done so that if the
player enters a water sector with a blue tint, you don't see the water tint until the camera goes under the water.
Otherwise, it would look wierd if the air suddenly changed blue.
<P>
The first color effect (handle of 1) is reserved for tints. Removing this effect
(with <A href="../color/freecoloreffect.html">FreeColorEffect(1)</A>) will remove all sector tints and disable them.
<P>
<HR>
<SUP>1</SUP>In the author's testing, framerate was doubled when rendering through a Bespin Station door was
disabled.
