Fades a surface's light from a lower value to a higher one. It seems that LEC originally intended for the light animation
to repeat, because they started the animation at startup when the player would not even see it. But as it is, this is a 
one-time effect. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>animID</SPAN>=<CODE>SurfaceLightAnim(surface, start_light, end_light, change_time);</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>start_light:</SPAN> This is the 0-1 flex light that will be given to the surface when the animation begins.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>end_light:</SPAN> This is the 0-1 flex light that the anim will reach at the end of the animation. The end_light must
be equal to or greater than the start_light or the command will be ignored.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>change_time:</SPAN> This is the flex time in which the surface will fade from the start light to the end light. Although
this time should be in seconds, the unit seems to be closer to a half-second.
