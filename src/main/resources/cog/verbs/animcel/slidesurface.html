Adds velocity to a surface in the given direction. The same velocity will be given to anything on the surface. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>animID</SPAN>=<CODE>SlideSurface(surface, norm_vec, speed);</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>norm_vec:</SPAN> A normalized vector giving the direction for the surface to move.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>speed:</SPAN> This is the flex speed for the movement.
<P>
The velocity given to an object on the surface does not have to match the movement of the surface.
For example, a horizontal surface cannot move up. But, that upwards velocity will be given to the things on the surface
- creating a sort of trampoline effect.
<P>
Normally, the surface texture and any things attached to the surface will move at the same speed.
However, there are a few <A href="../../../flags/surface/surface_frame.html" target="main">Surface Flags</A> that will scale the surface texture scroll speed.
This causes the surface texture to scroll at a different speed than the things that are attached to the surface.
<P>
