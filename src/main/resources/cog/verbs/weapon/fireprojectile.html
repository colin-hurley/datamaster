<H2>FireProjectile</H2><HR>
This verb's main purpose is to fire projectiles for the weapon cogs, but because of its versatility, this verb can be used
for other purposes. Syntax:
<P>
<SPAN class=return>projectile</SPAN>=<CODE>FireProjectile(fire_thing, template, sound, submode, offset_vec, error_vec,
extra_flex, proj_flags, AA_FOVX, AA_FOVZ);</CODE>
<P>
<SPAN class=param>fire_thing:</SPAN> This is the thing to fire the projectile from. The fired projectile will travel in the
direction that this thing is looking. And if the fire_thing is a creature, the projectile will travel in the direction of the creature's
torso, and not the true lookvector of the fire_thing.<SUP>1</SUP>
<P>
The fired projectile will be linked to the fire_thing's parent chain. If the fire_thing has itself for a parent, it will become the
parent of the projectile. Read the <A href="../thingprop/notes.html#parent">Thing Property Notes</A> for more information
on parents.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>template:</SPAN> This is the template to create the projectile from.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>sound:</SPAN> This is a sound to play as the projectile is created. Use -1 for this parameter if you
don't want to play a sound.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>submode:</SPAN> This is the submode number of a keyframe in the fire_thing's puppet. When the
projectile is fired, the keyframe will be played with the fire_thing. The most common submodes used are 8 for small fire
and 18 for large fire. Use -1 for no animation.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>offset_vec:</SPAN> This is an offset from the player's position that the projectile will appear at.
It is in the form of <SPAN class=exam>'sideways forward upward'</SPAN> and is given in JKUs. Projectiles are usually
put a little in front and to the right of the fire_thing so that they look better in the POV camera.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>error_vec:</SPAN> This vector is used to give aiming error to projectiles. It is given in the form:
<SPAN class=exam>'upward sideways 0'</SPAN>. The error vector is, of course, 2d because you can't aim in front
or behind a target.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>extra_flex:</SPAN> This flex is used by various
<A href="../../../flags/projectile/projectile_frame.html" target="main">Projectile Flags</A> to control the projectile.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>proj_flags:</SPAN> These <A href="../../../flags/projectile/projectile_frame.html" target="main">Projectile Flags</A>
control how the projectile is fired.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>AA_FOVX:</SPAN> This is the lateral Field of View in degrees. If an enemy is within this FOV,
the projectile will be aimed at it. The 0x20 <A href="../../../flags/projectile/projectile_frame.html" target="main">Projectile Flag</A>
must be used to enable auto-aim, and the 0x40 flag must be used to make it work in multiplayer.
<P>
<SPAN class=param>AA_FOVZ:</SPAN> This is the vertical Field of View in degrees. Together, the FOVX and FOVZ
are used to create a 3d cone in front of the player. If the enemy is inside this cone, the projectile that is fired will be
auto-aimed at it.

<SUP>1</SUP>Because of this, projectiles fired from a player have the lookvector of the player's torso. Refer to the
