Resets the firewait delay originally set by <A href="activateweapon.html">ActivateWeapon()</A>. The firewait delay is how
long the engine waits before running the <A href="../../message/fire.html">fire</A> message again. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>ChangeFireRate(player, firewait);</CODE>
<P>
Note: Although the behavior of ChangeFireRate() appears to be deterministic, there seem to be inconsistencies with
when the change in firewait delay takes effect.  Namely, in some instances, the change takes effect after the current
execution of the fire message (that is, immediately), while in other instances, the change takes effect after the next
execution of the fire message.  <A href="setfirewait.html">SetFireWait()</A> always changes the firewait delay
immediately and seems to serve the same purpose as ChangeFireRate(), so SetFireWait() should generally be preferred
over ChangeFireRate() to ensure consistent results.  It is also interesting to note that weapons affected by the power
boost powerup (E.g. Bryar Pistol) use ChangeFireRate() to alter the firewait delay, while weapons that are not
affected by the powerup (E.g. fists, lightsaber) use SetFireWait() instead.
