Synchronizes the server's scores with other computers in the game. This command
seems to be only a failsafe, because the server normally syncs his version of the scores
with the clients. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>SyncScores();</CODE>
<P>
Since JK does not allow client computers to modify the scores, and because the
server will sync the scores even when the 0x4 MP Mode Flag is used, it is difficult
to know if SyncScores() will work on all computers or only the server's. It will
probably function only on the server's computer, and it's really not useful to client
cogs.
