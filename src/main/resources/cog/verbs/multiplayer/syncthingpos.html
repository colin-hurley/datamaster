<H2>SyncThingPos</H2><HR>
Synchronizes the local position of a thing with other computers in an MP game. The command
can be run from a client or server's computer. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>SyncThingPos(thing);</CODE>
<P>
When the other computers in a game receive the new position sent by SyncThingPos(), they
do not simply set the thing's position to the new position. If the distance is less than half a JKU,
they will apply enough force to the thing to move it to its more correct position in about a
second. Otherwise, the thing will be moved instantly.
