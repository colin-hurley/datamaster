<A name=pack><H4 style="margin-top:0">The Backpack System</H4></A>

A backpack is a special powerup that usually contains the weapons and ammo of a dead
player. Backpacks are created with <A href="createbackpack.html">CreateBackpack()</A>.
This verb will add all items whose inventory bin has the 0x80
<A href="../../../flags/inventory/inventory_frame.html" target="main">Inventory Flag</A> to the backpack.
<P>
<A href="pickupbackpack.html">PickupBackpack()</A> is used to add all of the items in the
backpack to a player's inventory. But PickupBackpack() was probably created to replace a
more complicated system using the NthBackpack verbs. Should you want to use those
obsolete verbs, or just learn the system, here's a chart showing how they work:
<P>
<TABLE class=small align=center width=70% bgcolor=silver cellpadding=3 border=1>

</TABLE>
<P>
The number of items in a backpack is returned by <A href="numbackpackitems.html">NumBackpackItems()</A>.
Once you know how many items are in a backpack, how do you find out what they are?
<A href="nthbackpackbin.html">NthBackpackBin()</A> will return the bin ID of an item. And once you have the
bin number, you can find out how much is in the bin with <A href="nthbackpackvalue.html">NthBackpackValue()</A>.
This verb returns the amount of the given item.

<A name=team><H4>Team System</H4></A>

When teamplay is used in a normal multiplayer game, four teams can be used: red, yellow, blue, and green.
When teamplay is not checked, all players will have a team of 0 which cannot be changed. Remember that
whether teamplay is on or not, players always have a team.

<A name=team><H4>Sync Verbs</H4></A>

The Sync Verbs are used to synchronize information on one computer with the other computers
in a multiplayer game. This is mostly done for joining players to sync effects created before
they joined.
<P>
Once a Sync Verb has been run in a cog, it will run automatically when another player joins to sync
the effect again for another joining player.
