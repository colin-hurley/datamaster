<H2>SyncThingState</H2><HR>
This verb should synchronize the local state of a thing with other computers in multiplayer,
but the only apparent affect is to sync the thing's position. This verb can be run from a
client or server's computer. Syntax:
<P>
<CODE>SyncThingState(thing);</CODE>
<P>
Unlike <A href="syncthingpos.html">SyncThingPos()</A>, SyncThingState() syncs the thing's position instantly. It is difficult to
tell what SyncThingState() may really sync. These verbs were designed to sync effects
that occurred before a player had joined. But because JK completely syncs every thing in
the level for joining players anyway, this verb is not useful for that pursose.
