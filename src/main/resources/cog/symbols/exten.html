<HR><SPAN class=title>local</SPAN><BLOCKQUOTE>

	local is the most common symbol extension. It means that the variable is local to the cog and is not given a value in the
	level's .jkl file. This doesn't mean that if you leave out the local, the variable will be global and accessible to all cogs.
	<P>
	If a symbol does not have the local extension and its cog is defined in the cogs section of a JKL, then the symbol
	can be given an initial value from the JKL (see the <A href="general.html">Symbols General</A> document). Example:

	<PRE class=exam>int	 integer	local</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE><HR><SPAN class=title>desc</SPAN><BLOCKQUOTE>

	desc is short for description. It is used to comment on a symbol. Example:

	<PRE class=exam>thing	 item	 desc=powerup</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE><HR><SPAN class=title>mask</SPAN><BLOCKQUOTE>

	Mask is used to assign <A href="../../flags/thingtypemask/thingtypemask_frame.html">Mask Flags</A> to a symbol.
	The Mask Flags control which messages sent by the symbol are received by the cog.
	Mask Flags can only be used with symbols whose values are passed from the level's JKL.
	Example:

	<PRE class=exam>sector	sec1	mask=0x4</PRE>

	The default mask flags appear to be 0x401 for all symbol types.
	The mask entension is used to reset the Mask Flags for a symbol, so the default flags are overwritten.
	<P>
	When a message is sent by the symbol, the cog will only receive the message if the <A href="../../flags/thingtypeval/thingtypeval_frame.html">thing type</A> of the message source is represented in the mask flags for the symbol.
	For example, when a projectile hits an actor, the touched message normally does not run in the actor's cog.
	This is because the default mask only allows messages to be received when the source is a player thing (0x400) or nothing (0x1), not when the source is a projectile (0x8).
	If we give the thing a mask of 0xfff, every type of thing that touches the actor will cause the touched message to run.

</BLOCKQUOTE><HR><SPAN class=title><A name=linkid>linkid</A></SPAN><BLOCKQUOTE>

	Linkid provides a way to assign an ID to a symbol that generates messages. This ID can be retrieved in messages sent by the object
	with <A href="" onClick="FramePage('../verbs/message/message.html', '../verbs/message/getparam.html', 150); return false">GetSenderID()</A>.
	Linkids can only be used with objects whose values are passed from the level's JKL. Example:

	<PRE class=exam>sector	sec1	linkid=1</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE><HR><SPAN class=title><A name=nolink>nolink</A></SPAN><BLOCKQUOTE>

	Nolink blocks the messages sent by a symbol from being received by its cog. Nolink is only used with symbols whose
	value is passed from a level's JKL. Example:

	<PRE class=exam>sector	sec1	nolink</PRE>
