<H2>Surface Symbol Type</H2><HR>
The surface symbol type is used to store the reference number of a surface. If the surface's value
is passed from a JKL, any messages sent by the surface will be received by the symbol's cog. Syntax:
<PRE class=sym>surface     surf1</PRE>
<P>
<B>Mask Info:</B> Surfaces can send several messages to their cogs. Giving the surface
<NOBR><A href="../../../flags/thingtypemask/thingtypemask_frame.html" target="main">Mask Flags</A></NOBR>
allows the cog to ignore messages from the surface caused by things that were
excluded by the mask. Surfaces also use default masks, perhaps 0x400.
