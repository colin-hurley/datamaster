<H2>Surface Symbol Type</H2><HR>
The surface symbol type is used to store the reference number of a surface.
Passing the surface's value from the JKL allows messages sent by that surface to be received by the cog.
This is the only way to receive messages sent by a surface.
Syntax:
<PRE class=sym>surface     surf1</PRE>
