<H2>Cog Symbol Type</H2><HR>
The cog symbol type is used to store a reference to a cog. Syntax:
<PRE class=sym>cog     classCog</PRE>
<P>
Unlike other symbol types that can take a file name as an initial value (e.g.
keyframe, model, sound), a cog symbol can only be assigned a numerical reference.
The reason the cog file name cannot be assigned is because there can be multiple
instances of a single cog file running in the level at the same time, each with
its own reference number, and the cog file name alone is not sufficient to
distinctly identify any particular instance.  A cog reference can be passed from
a JKL - in Jed, this would typically be the number for one of the cogs in the
Placed Cogs window.
