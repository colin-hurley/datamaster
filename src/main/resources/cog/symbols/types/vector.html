<H2>Vector Symbol Type</H2><HR>
The vector type can be used for many purposes. It's designed to hold three numbers in one variable.
Variables of this type are used for positions, vectors, RGB tints, etc - anything that
can use three numbers. Syntax:
<PRE class=sym>vector      vec1</PRE>
<P>
You cannot directly assign a value to a vector in the symbols section, but vector values can be passed
to the variable from a JKL. Use the form: <SPAN class=exam>(x/y/z)</SPAN>.
<P>
Also, you cannot directly compare one vector to another. This example:
<P>
<code>if(vector1 == vector2) // then whatever</code>
<P>
will not work. You will have to compare each axis of the vectors seperately. With MotS, you have
VectorEqual() to solve this inconvenience.
