The material symbol type is used to store a reference to a mat file. Like other
variables, materials can have their initial value passed from the level JKL, but
you cannot pass a value of -1 from the level or the engine will use 32768 (the static.jkl offset). Syntax:
<PRE class=sym>material     mat1=dflt.mat</PRE>
