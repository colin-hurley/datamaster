<H2>Thing Symbol Type</H2><HR>
The thing symbol type is used to store a reference to a thing. Syntax:
<PRE class=sym>thing     thing1</PRE>
<P>
<B>Mask Info:</B> Masking things (by adding <A href="../../../flags/thingtypemask/thingtypemask_frame.html" target="main">Mask Flags</A>
to the symbol) controls what event messages sent by the thing will be handled by the cog. If the thing which caused the event was
excluded by the mask, then the event message will be ignored.
<P>
Normally, when a projectile hits an actor, the touched message does not run in the actor's cog - the default
mask does not allow projectiles. But if we give the thing a mask of 0xfff, every type of thing that touches
the actor will cause the touched message to run.
<P>
The default thing mask may be 0x404.
