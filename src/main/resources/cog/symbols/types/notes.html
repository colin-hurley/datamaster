<H2>Notes on Symbol Types</H2><HR>

<H4 style="margin-top:0">Symbol Examples</H4>

The examples of symbol type syntax given in this section do not have
symbol extensions. But all symbol types with the exception of messages
can use at least the "local" and "desc" symbol extension. Symbol types for objects
that send messages can use all of the symbol extensions.
<P>
Also, most of the examples show the symbol being given an initial value.
No variable has to be given an initial value, it is only done in the examples
to show that a variable accepts one.

<H4>Integer Values</H4>

Cog's integers are signed 4-byte values. The maximum value is 2,147,483,647 and the minimum value
is -2,147,483,648.
<P>
<B>When giving integer values (e.g., operands, arguments):</B> If you exceed the maximum integer, then the integer will
"wrap around" to its lowest value and will add from there. If you exceed the minimum integer, then the
integer will be given its maximum value and will subtract from there.
<P>
<B>When using integers in an operation (e.g, 2147483647 + 10):</B> If the resultant integer exceeds the maximum
or minimum integers, Cog will change the result to 2147483648 - note that this number is unsigned and is 1 greater
than the maxint.

<H4>Floating-point Values</H4>

Cog's floating-point types (flexes and floats) are also signed 4-byte values. With no decimal point, these
numbers have the same minimum and maximum values as integers (and the same rules apply). But the
more decimal digits a float has, the less precise the float will be. Note that this description of "floating-point
values" applies to floating-point operations (e.g., modulo) as well.
<P>
Precision is a quality of floating-point numbers that describes how many significant digits a variable type
can hold. As mentioned above, precision is not constant. The more decimal digits you have, the less
precise the number will be.
<P>
Cog's floats have a maximum precision of about 9 digits - which means that at the most, a float can store
and use 9 significant digits with no loss of precision. The minimum precision is 6 digits (with all significant digits
being to the right of the point), but remember that Cog only displays the first 6 decimal digits.
<P>
This precision factor is caused by the way fractional numbers are stored in memory. Unlike positive numbers,
they are stored approximately - and after so many digits of precision, the accuracy of the stored number will
fail. Since floating-point numbers cannot always be trusted, we have to be careful with what operations we
use them in.
<P>
<H4>Floating-point Operations</H4>

As was just said above, floating-point numbers spanning more than six digits may suffer a loss of precision.
Here are two examples:
<P>
<CODE>PrintFlex(111.222333 * 1000);</CODE>
<BR>"111222.335958" prints.
<P>
<CODE>PrintFlex(111222333 % 1000);</CODE>
<BR>"336.000000" prints.
<P>
In both examples, you can see the limit of the precision of floating-point numbers.
