The symbols section is used to list variables and give them an initial value. It is not necessary to declare variables in the symbols,
but because LEC did, it's considered proper Cog programming. Each cog has a limit on the number of variables of each symbol type
that it can store.
<P>
There are basically three types of variables: integer, flex, and vector. Sectors, things, surfaces, models, etc all boil
down to an integer number.
<P>
The symbols sections of cogs listed in the items.dat and the static.jkl are loaded only once when JK starts. They are not reloaded with
every level. Cogs loaded by the level's JKL will be loaded every time the level is loaded. Also, the values of each cog's variables are
stored until you exit JK entirely. When a variable is listed in the symbols section, it is given a value of zero by default.
<P>
If you declare two variables with the same name in the symbols section, only the first will be recognized; this is regardless of the
variables' types. If you give a variable the same name as a Cog verb, that verb will not work in the cog.
<P>
A variable's type will be reset to match whatever type you assign it to. For example, if you define an integer in the
symbols section and then assign that integer to a vector value of '1 2 3', the integer will be turned into a vector to accommodate this new value.
<P>
You cannot define a variable in one cog and retrieve its value in another. Even though cog has a variable extension
called "local," ommitting this extension will not allow you to access variables in other cogs.

<H4>Defining Variables from the Level</H4>

If the cog is listed in the cogs section (not the cogscripts section) of a .jkl, the JKL can pass values to the variables
in the symbols section. This is how JED gives values to variables in placed cogs. Here's an excerpt from the cogs
section of a JKL:

sector doorSector       local
int       numDoors=0    local
int       doorStatus       local
int       moveStatus      local
int       i                      local

end
</PRE>
Notice that the seven values listed in the JKL correspond to the seven variables in the symbols section without the "local" extension.
The messages listed in the symbols are variables, but they are ignored when JK passes variable values from a JKL.
<P>
It is convenient to define level-specific things like the doors in the level so that simple cogs like 00_door become generic.
This value-passing does not work with the static.jkl.
<P>
When an object's value is passed from a JKL, the cog will receive messages sent by that object. This is the only way to receive
messages sent by sectors and surfaces.

<!-- <H4>Declaring Messages</H4>

	Messages tutorial supercedes this.

Messages are special variables. They are predefined constants with an integer value, but they must be
declared in the symbols so that JK knows they exist in the code section. If you give a variable the same name as
a message and the message is not declared in the symbols, then the variable will override this predefined message.
