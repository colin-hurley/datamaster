Welcome to the Jedi Knight DataMaster. This reference was created to recatalogue all of the known information
on Jedi Knight's Cog language. The DataMaster project began over four years after Jedi Knight's release, and the first version
was completed in three months.
<P>
The DataMaster is an ongoing project. If you have information that is not included in this reference, or if you find a mistake, send
an email to the address below so that the DataMaster can be updated. Also, if the tutorials aren't easy enough to understand, send
an email with your suggestions.
<P>
Since version 0.1.8 of the DataMaster, you can view the descriptions of categorized items in two ways - in frames or popup windows.
