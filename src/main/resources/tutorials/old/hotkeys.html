<H2 style="margin-bottom:0">Creating New Hotkeys</H2><HR>
A "hotkey" is a key on your keyboard which has a command assigned to it in the keyboard control options.
Many of these hotkeys are linked to a cog; others, such as jump, are handled by the engine. This tutorial will show
you how to create your own hotkey and link it to a cog.
<P>
Here's an example of a hotkey's cog:
<PRE class=code>
# Hotkey.cog
#
#==================================================#
symbols

message	activated

end
#==================================================#
code
#--------------------------------------------------------
activated:
     Print("Acitvated");

Return;
#--------------------------------------------------------
end
</PRE>

The activated message will be sent when the hotkey is pressed. So when you press a hotkey linked to this cog, you
should see "Activated" appear on the screen. If your hotkeyable bin is for an item (explained later), the deactivated message
will be sent when you release the hotkey.
<P>
Now that we have the hotkey cog, we need to make the hotkey to run it.
<P>
First, put the cog you want to assign a hotkey to in Resource\cog<SUP>1</SUP>, put the items.dat in the Resource\misc
folder, and then put the jkstrings.uni in the Resource\ui folder. You can copy the items.dat and the
jkstrings.uni out of the gob files in your resource folder.
<P>
Open up the items.dat. Scroll down to the bottom. The last bin in the items.dat is 115. We'll take up where LEC
left off and use bin 116. Add the following into the items.dat after bin 115:

<PRE class=code>
binName               116             1        1         0x120    cog=hotkey.cog
</PRE>

Replace binName with whatever you want the bin named. The two ones are the minimum and maximum values of
the bin that you can have. You can use the hotkey when you don't have anything in the bin, but if your bin
is for an item, the selection box will flicker when it views the item.
<P>
The 0x120 is an <A href="../flags/inventory/inventory_frame.html">Inventory Flag</A>. This flag combines the 'hotkeyable' flag (0x100)
and the 'available by default' flag (0x20). If the bin is not available, the hotkey will not work and it won't be shown in the
selection box. You can use cog verbs to make the hotkey available, but using the 0x20 flag is easier in this case.
<P>
To make the deactivated message run, you must make your hotkey bin an item like the fieldlight. To do this, add
the flag 0x2 to your inventory flags. EG, 0x122. But as with any item, you will have to give it an icon for the
item selection box.
<P>
To do this, first create an icon and convert it to a .bm file. Then place your bitmap in the Resource\ui\bm folder
(create it if you have to). The name of the icon has three parts. The name begins with "ic" which stands for icon.
The next part is the first five letters of your bin name. The last part is the number "8" for 8-bit or "16" for 16-bit.
You will have to create an 8-bit and a 16-bit version of your icon. Here are the two icons for the example bin
above:
<BLOCKQUOTE class=pref>
icbinna8.bm
<BR>icbinna16.bm
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If the engine doesn't find these icon files, it will crash when you load a level.
<P>
Now save and close the items.dat. That's all we have to do with that file. Open up the jkstrings.uni. It's a big file,
so search for the phrase "ACTIVATE16". Right under Activate16, add in this:

<PRE class=code>
"ACTIVATE17"      0 "New Hotkey"
</PRE>

This will assign a name to your hotkey and make the engine look for another bin in the items.dat with the flag
0x100 to assign the new hotkey to. Save and close the jkstrings.uni.
<P>
Launch JK and go to the keyboard controls box. Scroll all the way down to the bottom. Double-click the new
hotkey and then press the key you want to use for it. Now load a level and try out your new hotkey. If you used
the hotkey cog given above, you should see a message print when you press the key.
<P>
In Jedi Knight, you can only add three hotkeys, but you can get many more in Mysteries of the Sith. To get
around this shortage in JK, you can steal hotkeys away from items like the fieldlight. Just remove their 0x100
flag and take out their entries in the jkstrings.

<SUP>1</SUP>If you are using the path command line parameter to use another resource directory, you can put the
cog, misc, and ui folders in your new directory instead of resource.
