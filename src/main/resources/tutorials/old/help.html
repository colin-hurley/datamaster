The tutorials in this reference aren't meant to cover everything. But there are quite a few other Cog tutorials on the web. So if you don't
find what you need in the DataMaster's tutorials, check the ones listed below. Hideki has written a great many Cog tutorials which are
available at <A href="http://www.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~t00214ho/millennium/tutorials/">Millennium</A>, his website.

No comprehensive tutorial on Cog is perfect. It is not uncommon in these tutorials, especially in older ones, for
there to be mistakes. So be wary when reading them.

<H4>Asking for Help on the Web</H4>

The best place to get online help for Cog problems is the <A href="http://forums.massassi.net">Massassi Cog Forum</A>.
<P>
When asking for help, there are several things you should and should not do.
<P>

<B>In General:</B>

<UL>
<LI>Title your message appropriately. A descriptive title such as "Actors in Multiplayer" is much more helpful that "Cog help."
<P>
<LI>Use correct grammar. No one who visits that message board wants to read murdered English. You might want to consult
a <A href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary">dictionary</A>.
<P>
<LI>Say whether or not the cog is for Multiplayer and if this needs to work in MotS or Jedi Knight.
<P>
</UL>

<B>When asking for a cog:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Explain in detail what you want the cog to do.
<P>
<LI>Make sure you know what you're asking for. You don't want a cog that you've no idea how to use. Ask for help if you need it,
but do that before you ask for the cog to be made.
</UL>

<B>When asking for code help:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Post the code with your request. If the message board uses the UBB system, be sure to enclose the code inside UBB
[code] tags. There should be a hyperlink to a help document that explains the tags somewhere on the site.
<P>
<LI>Only post the relevant parts of the code. If the cog is several hundred lines long, no one is going to read all of it. Just
post the part of the cog that you're having a problem with.
<P>
<LI>Be sure to explain exactly what your problem is. Don't expect people to read through your code to find out what you're having
trouble with.
</UL>

<B>When an Expert replies:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Read everything he says. Do not just skim over his message. Experts hate it when new editors ignore what they say
and post their question again.
<P>
<LI>If the solution he gives doesn't work the first time, keep trying to make it work. Don't give up until you've spent at least
a half hour working at it.
</UL>

<B>When your problem is resolved:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Explain how any problems were fixed. The expert who helped you needs to know so that he can help others who encounter
the same problem.
<P>
<LI>Say thankyou. It's all volunteer work and so you need to thank the experts who spent their time helping you.
</UL>
