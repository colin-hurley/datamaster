This text will explain how to set up your files for JK editing. Much of the stuff explained here is about
convenience. When you're working on a patch, you will have to run JK hundreds of times. The better
you have everything set up, the easier this will be.
<P>
<H4>Where To Install Jedi Knight</H4>

JK should be installed in an easy-to-reach directory. For many editing programs, you'll have to search through the directories
to find files in your JK dir. If you install JK to C:\Jedi Knight, it won't take too long. But if you install JK to C:\Program Files\Programs\Games\Jedi Knight,
it's going to take a lot longer.
<P>
Some editors install JK to their desktop folder for this reason.

<H4>Unneeded Files</H4>

There are a lot of files and folders in the JK directory that you won't need to use. Hiding them will save time. You should hide
everything but the JK.exe and the Resource and Episode folders. To do this, view the file's properties and click the "Hidden" attribute.

<H4>Patch Directories</H4>

When working on patches, you should create a seperate directory for each project. Say you have a project called Host Commander. Create
a folder inside your JK folder called host. Then create a shortcut to the JK.exe and view its properties. Add <I>-path host</I> to the end
of the target line of the shortcut.
<P>
When you run JK with this shortcut, it will search your patch directory before it looks in the Episode and Resource folders.

<H4>Quick Launch Bar</H4>

To make it easier to access your JK folder, Cog references, and other editing resources, you should put a link to them
in the Quick Launch bar. Drag the program into the bar and Windows will create a shortcut to it.

<H4>Send To</H4>

The folder C:\windows\sendto contains links to the programs that should appear in the right-click Send To menu. If you have more
than one program for editing a file type, this feature can be useful. You can have a cog open with one program, and if you need
to open the cog with another program, you can use the Send To menu to conveniently make the other program open it.
<P>
Doing this is only helpful in Windows 95 and 98, because in newer versions of Windows, you can use the Open With menu instead.
