Cog is an easy language to learn, but it does help if you have some programming experience. This tutorial
will walk you through the basics.
<P>
We'll begin with the infamous Hello World:

<PRE class=code>
# HelloWorld.cog
#
# Print "Hello World" on the screen when the level starts.
#
# [SM]
#==============================================#
symbols

message startup

end
#==============================================#
code
#-----------------------------------
startup:
   Sleep(1);
   Print("Hello World"); // Print the string

Return;
#-----------------------------------
end
</PRE>

When this cog is run, "Hello World" will appear at the top of the screen when a level is loaded.
<P>
The first section is the optional header. The pound sign is used at the beggining of each line so the
engine will not read the rest of the line. The header usually lists the name of the cog, a description, and
the author. 
<P>
The second section is the symbols section. It defines all of the variables and messages to be used
in the code section.
<P>
The third section is the code section. The code section performs the actual work of the cog.
Notice that the symbols and code sections begin with their name and end with an <EM>end</EM>.
<P>
The two Cog verbs used in that example were Sleep() and Print(). Sleep() was used to pause the code execution for
one second because startup runs just before the level starts. The Print() command prints a string to the screen.
<P>
The message, startup, is listed in the symbols section so the engine will look through the code section for
startup. The engine will process all code after the startup message until it hits a "return;" command which
tells it to stop.
<P>
The double slashes after the print command is another comment marker used by cog. It works the same way
as the pound sign, but remember that double-slash comments cannot be used outside of the code or symbols
sections. If they are, they will be treated by JK as a syntax error and the cog will not function.
<P>
Notice the syntax of this example. Each statement ends with a semicolon. Messages in the code section
have a colon after them. The parameters of the two verbs used are enclosed in parentheses.

<H4>Variables</H4>

A variable is like a storage bin that holds a value. There are different types of variables to hold different types of values.
You can use a variable anywhere that you can use a number. When JK processes code containing a variable name, it finds
the value of the variable and uses that in its place. It's as if a number had been written in the place of the variable.
<P>
Here's an example of how variables are declared in the symbols section:

<PRE class=code>
symbols

flex    real1      local
float   real2
int      integer

message startup

end
</PRE>

A symbol declaration has three parts. The first is the type of variable you're defining. The second part is the
name of the variable. The third part is an optional extension for the variable. All variables to be used in the code
section should be defined in the symbols section.
<P>
Here's an example of assigning values to variables and printing them:

<PRE class=code>
int1=5;
int2=10;
int3=2;
int4=int1 * int2 / int3;
PrintFlex(int4);
</PRE>

Int1, int2, and int3 are assigned to three integer numbers with the assignment operator (=). Int4 is assigned to an expression.
The expression returns a value which is then assigned to int4. Anything that returns a value can be thought of as an expression.
<P>
The mathmatical expression is processed before the assignment because the multiplication and division operators have higher
precedence than the assignment operator (read the <A href="../cog/operator/operators.html#precedence">Operators</A> document
for a chart showing the precedence of Cog's operators). The last line in the example prints the value of int4 (25) to the screen.

<H4>Conditional Statements</H4>

In most cogs, you will need to run different code depending on a true or false condition. Here is an example
of how to do this with the if statement:

<PRE class=code>
if(integer >= 5)
{
     SetTimer(5);
}
else
{
     SetTimer(1);
}
</PRE>

This example is easy enough to read. A different action is performed depending on the value of integer. When only
one statement is performed by a conditional statement, you don't have to use the brackets to mark a new code block.
This example will give the same results and save a few lines:

<PRE class=code>
if(integer >= 5) SetTimer(5);
else SetTimer(1);
</PRE>

Notice that the conditional statement itself <EM>does not</EM> end with a semicolon. But the statements after the if statement
must end with a semicolon.
<P>
For more on conditional statements, read the <A href="conditions.html">Conditions</A> tutorial.

<H4>Messages</H4>

Most messages are events that are sent when something happens ingame. The cog then receives the message and
starts executing code after the message's name in the code section.
<P>
Another type of message is the custom message. Here's an example:

<PRE class=code>
# HelloWorld.cog
#
# Print "Hello World" on the screen when the level starts.
#
# [SM]
#==============================================#
symbols

message startup

end
#==============================================#
code
#-----------------------------------
startup:
   Sleep(1);
   call printtext;

Return;
#-----------------------------------
printtext:
   Print("Hello World");

Return;
#-----------------------------------
end
</PRE>

The custom message in this example is printtext. Notice that it does not have to be defined in the symbols section.
The call keyword is used to run custom messages, because the engine will normally ignore them.

<H4>Cog Verbs</H4>

Verbs are the commands in the code section that perform all of the work. The set of parentheses after a verb encloses
its parameters. If there is more than one parameter, they are seperated by a comma. Look at this verb:

<PRE class=code>
SetTimerEx(0.5, 1, 0, 0);
</PRE>

Each verb has its own set of parameters. These parameters are values that are passed to the verb so that the verb
can perform its action. You can use variables, expressions, and other cog verbs as parameters. For example:

<PRE class=code>
SetTimerEx(0.5, 1, GetSenderRef(), GetSourceRef());
</PRE>

The verbs GetSenderRef() and GetSourceRef() both return values. These values are then given to SetTimerEx().
<P>
Read the <A href="verbs.html">Cog Verb</A> document for more information related to verbs.

<H4>Statements</H4>

Although you can have more than one statement per line, a statement can be considered a line of code that ends with a
semicolon. It's somewhat like a sentence ending with a period. The two SetTimerEx() examples above are typical
statements. Look at this example:

<PRE class=code>
startup:
   Sleep(1); Print("Hello World"); // Print the string

Return;
</PRE>

Notice that the two statements from Hello World have been put on one line. Here is another version of the conditional
statement example:

<PRE class=code>
if(integer >= 5) SetTimer(5); else SetTimer(1);
</PRE>

The if statement and the else statement can be put on the same line. But if you put two statements on the same line
without a semicolon for each, you will get a syntax error and your cog will not run.
