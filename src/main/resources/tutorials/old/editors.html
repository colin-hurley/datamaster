There are several cog editors available, but only two are worth using. EditPlus 2 and Cogwriter. EditPlus is
better, but has no syntax checker. Cogwriter has fairly good syntax checking, but it takes too long to load and
has nothing near the features of EditPlus. You can download a complete set of Cog files for EditPlus at
<A href="http://www.geocities.com/sabersdomain/fileframe.html">Saber's Domain</A>.
<P>
With the release of <A href="http://www.geocities.com/sabersdomain/fileframe.html">Parsec</A>, Cogwriter's syntax checker
has become obsolete for Jedi Knight. If you plan to use the MotS engine, then you will need Cogwriter because Parsec doesn't
support it. The author recommends that you download all three programs.
