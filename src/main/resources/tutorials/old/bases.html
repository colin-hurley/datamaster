<H4>Introduction</H4>

This tutorial will teach you what bases are and why they are useful. This isn't meant to be a complete or
perfect description of numerical bases. This tutorial's purpose is to disseminate useful information on bases
to beginners in an easy-to-understand context.

<H4>Nomenclature</H4>

Here's the definition of a few basic, and somewhat controversial, terms that you'll need to
understand for base math:
<P>
<B>digit</B>
<UL>
Any numeral used to express a number, or the column (e.g., ones, tens) which the numeral
occupies.
</UL>
<B>number</B>
<UL>
A number is an idea of an amount. You cannot write a number without limiting yourself to
some form of expression, but the number is the amount that exists.
</UL>
<B>numeral</B>
<UL>
Numerals are characters which aid in expressing numbers. They are not numbers in themselves,
but only a form of expression for a number. For example, in decimal 10, the '1' and '0' characters are the
numerals. The amount of things that the 1 and 0 represent is the number.
</UL>

We'll use these terms extensively in the following text, so it's important to understand them now.

<H4>What Bases Are</H4>

A <I>base</I> is a system of displaying a number with numerals. It is only a way of displaying the number,
it does not change the number itself. A number is an idea that represents an amount. For example, 100
in base 16, 256 in base 10, and 400 in base 8 are all the same number. The only thing that has changed
is the way the number appears. Note that we say these numbers are <I>in</I> the base that is used to display
them.
<P>
At first, this is necessarily very confusing. Understand that in each base, there is a maximum value that
each digit can hold before the number must use the next highest digit. In base 10, which seems almost
natural to us, the maximum value that can be displayed in a digit is 9.
<P>
Now to explain the example above. 100 in base 16 is 256 in base 10 because base 16 (as its name implies)
displays more values in each digit than decimal does. Because it displays 6 more values than decimal
in each digit, base 16 can display the same value with lesser and often fewer numerals.
<P>
You may be wondering now, what base 16 displays those extra numerals as since there are no more numerals
to use after 9. This is something we'll get to in the next section.

<H4>A Lising of the Bases</H4>

The following table gives a name for each base and lists the characters that it uses:
<P>
<TABLE> 
<TR><TH width="50">Base</TH><TH width="120">Name</TH><TH width="100">Characters</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>2</TD><TD>binary</TD><TD>0-1</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>19</TD><TD>*nonadecimal</TD><TD>0-i</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>20</TD><TD>vigesimal</TD><TD>0-j</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Note that although these names are based on common Latin prefixes and roots, they are not all standard
names. The asterisks are used to mark the names that are more invention than standard. Hexadecimal, while being fairly
standard, is not the correct name for base 16 according to the Latin system. Had sensibly-minded people
not intervened, the name would have been something like sexadecimal, but the problem there is obvious.
<P>
As you can see in the table, letters are used after the numerical character 9. This is also an invention;
letters were chosen to represent numbers because they were easily typed and easily displayed by computers.
<P>
Also apparent here is that each base name is one greater than its highest digit value. For example, base 2 does not
use a '2'. This is because each base starts designating numbers at 0. Base 2 is called base 2 because it can display
2 values per column.

<H4>Thinking From Decimal</H4>

Base 10, known as decimal, is the base that we normally use for math. We use base 10 over the other
bases because we humans (well most of us) have ten fingers. And because humans learned to count
with their fingers, base 10 seems natural (if it doesn't, we'll get to that later).
<P>
Since we <I>must</I> use a base when displaying, or if the number will use two digits, speaking a number,
we use decimal. This is how each base is named (e.g., base 16) - according to the decimal display of the
number of values per digit that the base uses.
<P>
So keep in mind that base 16 wouldn't be called that if everyone used it. Because in base 16, the decimal
16 would be displayed as 10.
<P>
Some people go overboard with base 10 - creating the impression that the "real" version of a number is
its decimal display. This is in the author's opinion a bad mistake to make. You should take care to note
which base a number is in when working with bases other than decimal.

<H4>Counting on your Fingers</H4>

As easy as this is to understand, it may end up being a source of confusion for some. Despite what you
and millions of other people may think, your hands use base 11. Think about it, you can display any number
from 0 to 10. That's base 11.
<P>
But here's the rub: In mathmatics, you'll carry over to the next digit after you cannot display anything greater
in that digit with the base you're using. But you won't when counting on your fingers. You'll display 10
by holding out all of your fingers - but this would be the same as holding out one finger if you were counting
in tens.
<P>
So in decimal math, there is no inbetween '10' character for the first digit. You'll get to 9 and then carry over.
But when counting on your fingers, you'll get to 9, and then you can carry over <I>or</I> hold out your tenth finger.
And holding out all of your fingers displays the same number as does holding out one finger when counting tens.

<H4>Carrying Over</H4>

You know now that higher bases can display the same numbers as lower bases, but with fewer digits and
lesser numerals. For example, 100 in base 16 is 256 in decimal. For this to make sense, we have to
understand that the digits in base 16 are <I>worth more</I> than the digits in base 10.
<P>
Why? Because base 16 has to count through more digit values before it carries over to the next digit. For example,
one less than 100 in base 16 is FF. Decimal does not display so many values per digit, so it carries over when it reaches
9. Hexadecimal, on other hand, goes up to F before it carries over to the next greater digit. This helps us to
understand why the digits are worth more in higher bases - they are bought at a higher price, so to speak.

<H4>Digital Powers</H4> <!-- And no, it does not mean someone has powerful fingers. :p  -->

Before going on to base conversions, let's look at the decimal power of each digit. Here's a table with the more common bases:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TH width="100">Base</TH><TH width="70">Digit 0</TH><TH width="70">Digit 1</TH><TH width="70">Digit 2</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>Binary<SUP>&nbsp;</SUP></TD><TD>1 (2<SUP>0</SUP>)</TD><TD>2 (2<SUP>1</SUP>)</TD><TD>4 (2<SUP>2</SUP>)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Octal<SUP>&nbsp;</SUP></TD><TD>1 (8<SUP>0</SUP>)</TD><TD>8 (8<SUP>1</SUP>)</TD><TD>64 (8<SUP>2</SUP>)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Decimal<SUP>&nbsp;</SUP></TD><TD>1 (10<SUP>0</SUP>)</TD><TD>10 (10<SUP>1</SUP>)</TD><TD>100 (10<SUP>2</SUP>)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Hexadecimal<SUP>&nbsp;</SUP></TD><TD>1 (16<SUP>0</SUP>)</TD><TD>16 (16<SUP>1</SUP>)</TD><TD>256 (16<SUP>2</SUP>)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<!-- The <SUP>&nbsp;</SUP> in the table above are to make the base names line up with their digit values. -->
<P>
As you can see, the decimal value of each digit in a base is determined by finding baseNum to the power of digitNum. For example,
if baseNum were 16 for hexadecimal, and digitNum were 2 for the third digit, the decimal eqivalent of a 1 in digit 2 would be 256.
That is, the value of a 1 in hexadecimal's digit 2 would be the same as 256 in decimal. This provides us with a tool for conversion
to and from decimal.
<P>
But remember that we're using decimal to do the math so the conversion can only be used with decimal numbers. If we were to
use other bases with this conversion system, we would have to make another table.

<H4>Base Conversion</H4>

The typical, oxymoron approach is to pop out the Windows calculator and convert your number. But the problem is, Real
Programmers don't use calculators. So you'll have to learn the conversion algorithms. <!-- Real Programmers don't exist! -->
<P>
When converting from one base to another, decimal (being ingrained) will be the base that is used to do the
math. So you'll be converting from one base to decimal and then to another base if need be.
<P>
First, we'll do some simple conversions from octal to decimal using the chart above.
<PRE>
Convert the octal number 25 to decimal:
For digit 1: 2 * 8 = 16. Add 16 to our result.
For digit 0: 5 * 1 = 5. Add 5 to our result.
The result is: 21.
</PRE>
In that example, we simply multiplied each digit by its decimal value from the chart above, and then added
the products to find the result. Now let's convert back to octal.
<PRE>
Convert the decimal number 21 to octal:
There are no 64's in our number.
There are two 8's in our number. Add 20 to our result.
There is a remainder of 21-16=5.
There are five 1's left. Add 5 to our result.
The result is: 25.
</PRE>
In this last example, we went through each octal digit in our chart from greatest to least. We found
two 8's in our number. Because we found these two 8's, we added two 10's to our result because
10 is decimal's value for digit 1 and the 8 is octal's value for digit 1. Now let's do a conversion from
decimal to binary.
<PRE>
Convert the decimal number 13 to binary:
There are no 16's in our number.
There is one 8 in our number. Add 1000 to our result.
There is a remainder of 13-8=5.
There is one 4 in our number. Add 100 to our result.
There is a remainder of 5-4=1.
There are no 2's in our number.
There is one 1 in our number. Add 1 to our result.
The result is: 1101.
</PRE>
That example used some binary digits not on our chart, but we know that the numbers for binary digits 3 and 4
are 8 and 16 respectively. Now let's convert back to decimal.
<PRE>
Convert the binary 1101 to decimal:
For digit 3: 1 * 8 = 8. Add 8 to our result.
For digit 2: 1 * 4 = 4. Add 4 to our result.
No value for digit 1.
For digit 0: 1 * 1 = 1. Add 1 to our result.
The result is: 13.
</PRE>
Now, we'll do a more complicated hexadecimal to decimal conversion in slightly different form.
<PRE>
Convert the hexadecimal 2EA.F to decimal:
result = (2 * 16<SUP>2</SUP>) + (14 * 16<SUP>1</SUP>) + (10 * 16<SUP>0</SUP>) + (15 * 16<SUP>-1</SUP>)
result = (512) + (224) + (10) + (15/16)
result = 746 + 0.9375
result = 746.9375
</PRE>
Notice in this last example that a decimal point was used in the hexadecimal number. We'll get to floating-point
numbers later on.  Also, 16 to the power of -1 is the same as 1/16. Let's convert the number back to hexadecimal.
<PRE>
Convert the decimal number 746.9375 to hexadecimal:
First the 746:
	There are two 256's in our number. Add 200 to our result.
	There is a remainder of 746-512=234.
	There are fourteen 16's in our number. Add E0 to our result.
	There is a remainder of 10.
	There are ten 1's left in our number. Add A to our result.
	The result is now: 2EA.
Now the fractional portion:
	result2 = 9375/10000
	result2 = 15/16 (reduced)
	There are fifteen 1/16's in our number. Add 0.F to our result.
The result is 2EA.F.
</PRE>

There are several important things to note in this example. Because a hexadecimal digit can hold a higher
value than a decimal digit, having ten 1's and fourteen 16's is reasonable. Because fractions in hexadecimal
are in sixteenths instead of tenths (as in decimal), 15/16 is the same as 0.F. It's just like having 9/10 in decimal
- it's the same as 0.9.

<H4>Common Bases and their Uses</H4>

For computing purposes, hexadecimal, octal, and binary are often used.
Hexadecimal is useful in computer science because it represents numbers in a compact form and because
it is easily converted to binary and back. With four bits, you can store any hexadecimal character from 0 to F.
Here's a table:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TH width="70">Decimal</TH><TH width="70">Binary</TH><TH width="70">Hexadecimal</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TD><TD>0</TR></TD>

<TR><TD>14</TD><TD>1110</TD><TD>E</TR></TD>
<TR><TD>15</TD><TD>1111</TD><TD>F</TR></TD>
</TABLE>
<P>
As you can see from the table, hexadecimal can represent the same value in much less space than binary
and decimal. Also, each hexadecimal number is represented by four bits (a nybble). This makes hexadecimal useful
for displaying memory values in an efficient form.
<P>
Hexadecimal is also useful for storing up to four boolean values in a digit. For example, any addition of 1, 2,
4, or 8 yields a number with known components. For example, 3=1+2, F=8+4+2+1, E=4+8+2, 9=8+1. Any
combination of 1, 2, 4, and 8 results in a number that can be decomposed into the numbers that add up
to it. If you look at the table above, you'll see why. It is this fact that Cog makes use of for its flag system.
<P>
One last thing about hexadecimal: it can be easily converted to and from binary in a much more simple
method than the previous conversion examples used. Using the table above, you can convert a binary number
of four bits to its hexadecimal form. So the number 11110011 is F3. Just seperate the binary number
into nybbles and use the table above to find the hexadecimal representation for that binary number.
<P>
Octal is similar to hexadecimal in that it is used for some of the same reasons. It's maximum digit value
is 7 which is represented in binary as 111. Only three bits are needed to store an octal digit.
Like hexadecimal, it is easily converted to and from binary - instead of nybbles, use groups of three bits.
<P>
Binary is extremely useful to computers because values of 0 and 1 - true and false - are easy to store and
transfer. The downside is that they are much less efficient in terms of the space that it takes to store and
display so many digits. For example, 9 in decimal is 1001 in binary.

<H4>Base Prefixes</H4>

As explained above, using a different base does not change the number you're displaying. It only changes
the form that it's shown in. When writing numbers, especially with programming, you must give the base
that a number is written in, if it is other than decimal.
<P>
Often enough, you will need to use hexadecimal or octal numbers in your code - for convenience, efficiency,
or what have you. Say you wrote in 100. When the interpreter/compiler/parser engine reads that, it will assume
that the number is in decimal form. So if you really meant a hexadecimal 100, you would have made a grave mistake.
<P>
To tell the engine what form the number is in, there are two fairly-standard base prefixes which can be put before
a number. These are '0x' for hexadecimal and '0' for octal. So if you want to give a hexadecimal 100, you would
write 0x100. Or if you wanted to write 100 in octal, you would write 0100. Other bases will have to be converted
to decimal. Note that not all compilers or interpreters support these prefixes. Cog, being based on C++, does support
them.

<H4>Floats and Bases</H4>

Something often confusing to people who are unfamiliar with bases is using floating-point numbers (floats). A
floating-point number is one that uses a decimal point and numerals to its right to display the fractional portion
of the number. Calling them 'decimal numbers' is misleading. Because these numbers have a decimal point does
not mean that they are limited to the decimal base.
<P>
A hexadecimal or octal number can have a decimal point just as base 10 numbers do. But, this is hardly
ever done. And since there is really no reason to have a floating-point number in hexadecimal or octal notation,
other bases are usually restricted to being integers - they must be whole numbers. In fact, not even the Windows
calculator allows floating-point numbers in non-decimal bases.

<H4>In Closing</H4>

In this tutorial, I've tried to explain concepts that would be useful to beginners trying to learn other bases
for programming reasons. It is my hope that this tutorial was understandable and that you learned
a useful skill from it.
