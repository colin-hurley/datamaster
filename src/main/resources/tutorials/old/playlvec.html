When GetThingLVec() is used to find the lookvector of a player, it returns his overall lookvector - not counting headpitch. In some
circumstances, you will need to find the lvec of the player's torso. Because projectiles are made to look in the direction of the player's
torso, firing a projectile and finding it's lookvector will give us the lookvector of the player's torso. It would be coded something like this:

<PRE class=code>
ghost=FireProjectile(player, ghost_template, -1, -1, '0 0 0', '0 0 0', 0, 0, 0, 0);
lvec=GetThingLVec(ghost);
DestroyThing(ghost);
</PRE>

Now the vector, lvec, holds the lookvector of the player with headpitch taken into account.
<P>
Instead of destroying the ghost through cog, you can put a timer in its template to remove it from the game after a short delay.
<P>
Many Cog editors used to think that the z axis of a lookvector returned by GetThingLVec() did not work. Remember that headpitch only
affects the upper half of the player, while an lvec is the direction that his whole body is looking.
