We'll that's the end of the DM's tutorials. Congrats and thankyou if you read through all of them.
It's the author's intent with this last chapter to explain a few things that most tutorials won't try
to explain because their way too specific.
<p>
Yeah, some of these tutorials are really easy, and calling this an "advanced" chapter is kind
of an exaggeration, but you were warned at the beginning that the tutorials were not in any
order or difficulty level.
