<h4>Definition</h4>

Encapsulation is kind of a general term used to describe seperating the code needed to perform a specific task
into its own subroutine or object. This allows you to hide a lot of the lower-level code that you won't want to
waste your time with, and it makes it easier for you to read and debug your code.
<p>
With Object-Oriented Programming, encapsulation takes on almost a whole new meaning. Instead of combining
all of the code needed to perform one task into a subroutine, you're putting it into the methods of an object. An
example of an object would be a thing in Jedi Knight gameplay, and an example of a method would be a verb
that can change the properties of a thing.
<p>
Cog is very much Object-Oriented, but it's a scripting language that differs
a lot from standard OOP as in C++. So if the above description helps you to understand objects and methods,
that's great. But be aware that true OOP languages have a lot of new syntax for objects and their methods.
<p>
We may not be able to encapsulate our code in objects, but we can still use message handlers and even whole
cog files to do the same thing. Just remember that even though the concept is the same as with other languages,
the implementation is a lot different.

<h4>Encapsulation with Handlers</h4>

For this example, we're not going to deal with real code, but let's assume that we have a cog that's about 500 lines
long. The purpose of this cog is to manage an AI starfighter - this cog will do everything needed to get the fighter
to fly around and attack enemies.
<p>
On startup, our cog will start a pulse that needs to: check the fighter's status, search for enemies, and fire at enemies.
We might also want to evade enemies chasing us, play some engine sounds, and depending on how good our AI needs
to be, we can fire some ghost projectiles to search for walls.
<p>
The simple approach would be to put all the code for this in the pulse message handler. But that would be an incredible
mess. We'd have one message that's about 400 lines long. This makes it really hard to read and debug your cog. So what
we need to do is break the cog up...
<p>
For each specific task that the pulse handler needs to accomplish, we'll create a new handler and we'll put a call in the
pulse. Our message names might be <code>fighter_search, fighter_mode, fighter_move, fighter_fire, engineSound,</code>
etc. 
<p>
With the pulse code broken up into many smaller handlers, we now have a much shorter, more readable pulse message. If,
for example, the fighter isn't moving, we can go to the fighter_move and look for the problem there. This also reduces the
amount of redundant code in your cogs - if you have the same three commands used in many places throughout your cog,
you can encapsulate those commands into their own message handler and then use a call statement.

<h4>Encapsulation with Cogs</h4>

Although breaking up large messange handlers into smaller ones makes large cogs more manageable, working with cogs
that are more than a few hundred lines can still be a headache - it's no fun working on the same cog for weeks at a time
and forgetting parts of the code as you try to improve it.
<p>
So what you can do is create several different cogs that encapsulate the main tasks you're trying to do. Remember our
grappling hook example from the Writing Cogs tutorial? We could easily have put all of our grappling hook's code into
the weap_bryar cog, and that's what most editors would do. But what if you have to troubleshoot something, it's really
awkward when your code is added on to another cog that you already know is working fine.
<p>
By giving the grappling hook its own class cog, we have encapsulated all of the grappling hook's tasks into the hook object
itself - because the class cog is a property of the object. This is much closer to OOP encapsulation that anything else
you can do in cog.
<p>
Another good reason to break up your cogs is when your writing client / server patches. It's much easier to debug
when you have one cog that contains all of the client-side code, and another that contains all of the server code.
Multiplayer coding is definitely one of the hardest things you can do in cog, and using proper encapsulation will
save you some time.

<h4>Redundant Code</h4>

Redundant code is the bane of good programming. In any place that you have the same or similar commands,
you use loops or calls to make your code shorter. Although this is more work for JK, making your code easier
to read and debug is well worth it.
<p>
But in some cases you'll end up with several cogs that all do pretty much the same thing - and even have most
of the same code. But each cog has something unique that it does so that you won't be able to just have one
cog. You may have everything encapsulated nicely - each cog performing its specific, unique task. But what
if you make an important to change to some of the code that all of the cogs use. Then you have to go to each
cog and make that change - this is a huge waste of time and there's a good chance that not all of the updates
make it to all of the cogs - and that's a nightmare.
<p>
Let's say for example, that you're making some AI actors that are going to be smarter than the average bear. You don't
want to just up the stats with AI files, so you're going to use class cog to do a lot of extra work for the AI. But not all
of the actors you're making are going to be the same: you want humanoids, arachnids, and reptiles. All of these
actors need to use the same decision process, but their weapons, models, sounds, animations, etc will all be different.
<p>
Doubtless the AI code will be the most important, and you should never have to copy large portions of code into
other cogs. So to fix this, there's a few things we can do. First, we could remove the actors' class cogs and
create one level cog where we could enter in the different resources that you know the actor will use. But if
we need to keep the class cogs, we could create a new AI logic cog and have the class cogs send and receive
user messages - all of the redundant code would now be in one place, but the comm between cogs could be
a problem. It depends entirely on your situation.
