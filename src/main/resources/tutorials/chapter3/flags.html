<h4>Introduction</h4>

This is just going to be a small tutorial focused on flags and hexadecimal. For a tutorial that covers binary, octal,
decimal, hex, and the related math, read the <a href="../old/bases.html">Numerical Bases</a> tutorial. Here, we're
only going to cover the basics of flags.

<h4>Bits & Boolean Values</h4>

A <i>bit</i> is the smallest unit of storage that computers use. It holds either a 0 or a 1. Remember from the
Variables tutorial that the Boolean type needs only a 0 or 1 to hold a true or false value. Cog doesn't have
a boolean type, and even if it did it would take up more than one bit.
<p>
So what we'll do is use all the bits in a regular integer to hold these true / false values. Cog's integers
have are 4 bytes long - that's 32 bits and boolean values we can store with one number.
<p>
Cog programmers commonly refer to a number used for boolean values as a <i>flag</i>. Flags aren't restricted
to any base (e.g., decimal, hex), they're just integer numbers.
<p>
Before we get to hex, go to the Flags Section of the DM, and look at a few pages. The numbers are given in hex,
but the point is that each line in the table is a true or false value that requires one bit to be turned on or off in the
flag that we use.

<h4>Hexadecimal</h4>

Hex is a base for displaying a number. The number itself is just an idea of how many things are there. To write
or speak a number, you have to limit yourself to a base. Base 10 is what we use, but computers use Base 2
(binary). Hex, which is Base 16, is easily converted to and from binary, and it's more readable if not easier
to learn.
<p>
The reason hex is easily converted to binary is that each digit in hex can display any combination of four digits
in binary. This is because binary displays 2 values per digit while hex can display 16 (notice that I have to use
decimal to write these numbers).
<p>
Here's a chart I'm borrowing from the bases tutorial:

</TABLE>
<P>
You can see that hex uses letters after it runs out of numerals to use. Look at 1, 2, 4, and 8 in that table. Notice
that each number uses only one bit. This means that we can add any combination of these numbers, and no
matter what it is, we can disassemble it back to what we added up. E.g., 1 and 8 make 9. You can only subtract
each of our key numbers once, so: 9 - 1 = 8. C - 4 = 8. Try it on your own.
<p>
Although we can write flags in decimal, bits don't evenly fit into decimal's digits, so doing simple addition gets
complicated. Let's say we have the flag 0x80F. The 0x at the beginning means that the number is being displayed
in hex. This is important because if you type a hex number without it, JK won't know it's in hex and will mistake
it for decimal or a variable name.
<p>
But back to 0x80F. An F means that the first digit has all four bits on - these would be listed as 0x1, 0x2, 0x4, and 0x8 in
the Flags Section of the DM. The third digit only has the the last bit turned on, and it's 0x800 by itself.

<h4>Using Flags</h4>

There are many different types of flags in JK. Each type has a name like Actor Flags, Thing Flags, Physics Flags, etc.
Let's use Thing Flags as an example. These are flags which are assigned to players and they're just store settings
that relate to every type of thing that JK works with (e.g., weapons, powerups, players).
<p>
These flags can be assigned with the verb SetThingFlags() and cleared with the verb ClearThingFlags(). SetThingFlags()
doesn't reset the flag, it just adds to it. You must use ClearThingFlags() to turn off bits in the flag. If you need to retrieve
the value of a flag, you'd use GetThingFlags().
<p>
And that's pretty much it for this tutorial. You don't have to know that much about bases to be great with flags. If you want
to learn more though, read the bases tutorial.
