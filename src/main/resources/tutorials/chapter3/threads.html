<H2 style="margin-bottom:0">Threads</h2><hr>

<h4>Definition</h4>

A <i>thread</i> is the standard programming term for the flow of control through code. If you're familiar with operating
systems and multi-processor systems, then you understand that PCs with more than one processor are capable of
running two threads simultaneously whereas systems with one processor can create the illusion
of multi-threading, but they can't actually run two threads at once.
<p>
Of course, the threads of a scripting language like Cog aren't going to be the "real" threads used by compiled languages,
but they are similar, and we can borrow the terminology.

<h4>How They Work</h4>

We've said before that when a cog receives an event that it has a handler for, JK finds that handler's label in the code
section and code execution begins. But what if that handler contains a sleep and another message is received before
the sleep ends? And what if it's the same event?
<p>
Threads are the answer to that problem. Cog is capable of having multiple threads for one cog, but JK will only work with
the last-created thread. Here's a coding example that's designed to work with the above scenario:

<pre class="code">
activated:
	if(on) return;
	on = 1;
	channel=PlaySoundLocal(yourSnd, 1, 0, 0); 
	Sleep(GetSoundLen(yourSnd));
	on = 0;

return;
</pre>

So in our example gameplay, a player activates a console and the above handler is run. The handler first checks to make
sure it finished playing the sound from the last time it was run. Now if the player activates the console twice in succession
before the sound finishes, the variable on will still have a value of 1, and the second thread will die with that return statement.
<p>
You can have up to five threads for each cog. Threads are local to their cogs - meaning that if one cog has five threads, it
won't stop another cog from having its five threads. Whenever a cog needs to create a new thread in response to an event,
the oldest thread that the cog has will die - or in some cases the new thread will not be created (as in a call).
<p>
Let's say that you have a lot of calls to carefully encapsulated messages in your code. But you've noticed after some recent
changes that some of your calls aren't working. You need to check and make sure that you don't have more than four calls
going at once (remember that the original message handler has a thread too).
<p>
Be careful when using sleeps that the sleep's handler won't be run again before the sleep ends. Otherwise, the thread
limit will be exceeded, and you'll have to wait for the sleeps to end before you can do anything. And because when JK
looks at the cog to see if it needs to do anything (like wakeup from a sleep), it will only look at the last thread. Now if the
cog's first four threads slept for only a half second, but the fifth thread slept for five, the cog would wait those five
seconds before going back to the first four threads.
<p>
If for some reason it's impossible for you to avoid too many threads building up or indefinite sleeping, JK provides
the Reset() verb to kill all threads except the current one. This can be a good safeguard, but if your code is well-written,
you shouldn't have to use it.

<h4>Affected Verbs</h4>

We've just gone over how calls and sleeps can cause thread problems, but any verb that causes another thread
to be created in its cog can cause the same problem.
<p>
When you use SendTrigger() to send a trigger out, this event message is sent out to all of the local cogs that are listening
- including the cog that sent the trigger. Whether that cog's trigger handler is looking for that sourceref or not, a thread
is still created for the handler - if you've already got some sleeps or calls going, two more threads (the thread that ran
SendTrigger() and the triggered thread) may take you over the limit.
<p>
This is true of any verb that waits until all local cogs have had a chance to answer its event message. If you use CreateThing()
in the class cog of the thing that's created, or if you use SendMessage() to send a message within a cog, you'll have the same
problem as with SendTrigger().

<h4>Alternatives</h4>

Instead of creating extra threads and waiting on them, you should use timers and pulses when you can. Timers and pulses are
very similar in implementation and neither of them takes up a thread while they're waiting to run. Although sleeps cause a lot of
problems, they aren't unstable or error-prone.
<p>
The above example, makes good use of a sleep, and there's no reason to switch to a timer. But in most cases, there's nothing
stopping events from happening almost simultaneously - so even if you have a sleep of a tenth of second, there's still a chance
of hitting the thread limit.
<p>
Imagine that there are ten fuel barrels in your level, and you're standing not too far away with a bryar. A few shots from you
and all of those barrels will blow within a tenth of a second. If the barrels' class cog has a sleep for the slight pause before
the explosion, then not all of the barrels will explode correctly. But if timers are used (and you can have a ton of timers), then
everything will blow up nicely.

<!-- Researched Post On Threads:
<P>

This is to follow up the conversion on Hellcat's 'Trigger causes cog to stall' post.
I've done some more research and here are the results:
<P>
The number of threads that can run for one cog is five. The reason for the confusion before is because
message calls (via the call keyword) will not work after the limit has been reached. But threads will still be
created for event messages such as activated. An older thread will be killed for the new one to run.
<P>

But which thread will be killed? I'm fairly positive that the last created thread will be killed - the Cog's fifth thread.
<P>

SendTrigger() which was causing problems with DeathSythe's example, is not doing anything differently from
other verbs like it. Other verbs that trigger cog events - and threads to be created for them - work the same
way (such as SendMessage() and CreateThing()). The verb will finish only when all local cogs have received
the event - and if they have a message handler for this event, they will start, and if not paused, finish the thread
for the event before going back to the original cog.
<P>

At first, this seemed pretty wasteful to me - making one cog wait for others to respond when it tries to do something.
But this is the way it has to work. If you send a message or trigger, you want the other cogs to have a chance
to respond before you continue with the rest of your code.
<P>

Suppose you create five threads for a cog. In an example I had with a hotkey's activated message, I made the first
four threads wait two seconds and the fifth one wait five seconds before printing a message that they'd finished.
The first four could not wake from their sleep until the fifth one did. So I think this proves that JK looks only at the
last created thread for a cog... If this highest thread is not ready to resume execution, JK goes on to the next cog.
Maybe this explains why JK kills the last created thread when it reaches the thread limit and needs to create a new thread.
<P>

Threads will not be created for events that do not have message handlers in the code section - even if the
messages are listed in the symbols section.
<P>

The purpose of Reset() is to kill all threads running in a cog except the current one - which I think has to be the last
created. So Reset() kills all threads below its own.
<P>

Timers and Pulses use a thread only when their timer has expired and a thread is needed to run the code in their
message. They don't need a thread when they're waiting to run. Pulses must be implemented in almost the same way
as timers, they use similar verbs, similar cog flags, and they both have a time value stored with the cog. And since
timers can be IDed, it would be very limiting if you could only have fewer than five timers and pulses at a time.
<P>

Most of the info above has been pretty well tested, but doubtless there will be discoveries that change some of it.
I'd appreciate it if some of you could do some testing to verify this.

Post  To DP Explaining Threads (early):
<P>

A thread is a lot different from a Cog. A Cog is just a file with a list of instructions.
This list has starting points which are message names and ending points which are
returns.
When a message is sent to a Cog, JK starts a thread for it. This thread will begin at the
message that was sent and keep going until it hits a return statement. When it finds a
return, the thread dies.
<P>

I haven't tested with more than one Cog, but I'm assuming that threads are local to the
memory set aside for each Cog. Meaning, using all available threads in one Cog does not
stop another Cog from running all of its threads. The limit for threads seems to be
around six, but that's not certain.
<P>

The problem that Hellcat has seems to be too many threads running at once. But DeathSythe's
problem is different in the way that it uses SendTrigger(). Apparently, SendTrigger()
pauses the current thread, and sends the trigger. And if the thread's Cog has a
trigger message, it will start a thread there before going back to the SendTrigger() thread.
<P>

The difference with SetTimer() is that this verb does not pause the current thread. It
just sets up the timer, and lets the thread finish.
<P>

But as I said above, I'm still not positive on all of this, I'll have to do a lot more testing. -->
