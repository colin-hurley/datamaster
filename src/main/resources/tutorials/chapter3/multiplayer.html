<h4>Introduction</h4>

Multiplayer coding is one of the hardest things to do in JK. The code itself isn't difficult to write - the hard part is making sure your cog
is running in sync on all computers. Most well-designed multiplayer cogs use a client / server system so that one cog is designated to
keep the other cogs in sync with it.

<h4>Multiplayer Flags</h4>

To control how your cogs will run in multiplayer games, there are several <a href="../../flags/cog/cog_frame.html">Cog Flags</a> you can use.
Take your time to read up on these flags - remember that cogs have default flags, and each type of cog has its own defaults. The main flags
we'll use are 0x40 and 0x200. 0x80 is also important, but we're not going to cover MotS.
<p>
Jedi Knight will sync a lot of things in the game. No one knows exactly what it does sync, but there are obvious things like the player's position
(btw, if the player is not significantly moving, the game won't sync his pos). That type of syncing is stuff that the engine takes care of, cog has
nothing to do with that. But other things like thing creation and changing models are synced with other computers only because the verb (FireProjectile()
and SetThingModel()) will take care of the syncing for you. Not all verbs will do this, and some verbs don't need to because JK is already syncing
whatever it changes.
<p>
Because multiplayer testing requires a few computers, and preferably a few people, not that much multiplayer research has been done. So you're
pretty much on your own for figuring out what JK syncs and what verbs do the syncing for you - usually you can make a good guess and you'll be
right.
<p>
What the 0x200 flag does is it stops verbs from syncing their changes with other computers. So if we have a cog that's going to run on every
client, we don't need it to waste time and bandwidth trying to sync changes with other clients that are doing the same thing. So we'd add 0x200
so that each client cog will only make changes locally.
<p>
By default, cogs run only on the server - in singleplayer, the computer is assumed to be the server. Class and inventory cogs are given the 0x40
flag by default so that they'll run locally on every computer - client and server. This is needed because your weapon cogs, for example, would be
useless if they only ran on the server's computer.
<p>
A combination of both of these flags (0x240) will make a cog run locally on every computer and not sync its changes. Most multiplayer cogs are
given this flag. But remember, if you have a simple server cog that needs to sync its changes (and the verbs you're using can do it), you won't
be using either of these flags (0x40 is useless to the server anyway).
<p>
There is no good way to find out what flags your cog has in JK - there's no verb to do it with. The only way we can guess at the purpose of JK's
flags is to test in MotS, and since MotS is slightly different, there's not a good way to make sure the flag info's accurate.

<h4>Client / Server Versions</h4>

<i>Latency</i> is the term used to describe the time it takes for one computer to send information to another. Most people just call this "lag time."
High latency can cause a lot of problems for our code because the goal of multiplayer cogs is to sync information between computers. And
when we have bad latency (depending on how much we need to sync), the difference between the server's information and the client's can
get bad enough to make your patch unplayable.
<p>
Let's say for example that you have exploding barrels that are created on a conveyor belt. This conveyor goes to a bunch of places in your level.
One of the things that JK doesn't sync is throwable objects, so if we want our barrels to be the same on all computers, we're going to have to
do that manually. And to make it harder, we want players to be able to score by killing other players with the barrels' explosions.
<p>
This kind of example is going to require a lot of communication, and if the barrels are not in the same places on all computers, then one player
may see a barrel blow up right in front of his target (because explosion effects are local), but on the target's computer, the barrel may be way
too far away to damage him - he'll see the explosion over there.
<p>
That is how latency causes problems for us. Suppose we have a latency of 200 milliseconds - this would be 56k dialup connection. This may
not seem like much time, but since our barrels are on a conveyor, we're going to see the barrels hopping all over the place as clients receive
old positions from the server. You'll see the client's barrel move smoothly down the conveyor, and as soon as your cog receives a trigger
with the new position, you'll see the barrel hop somewhere nearby.
<p>
And it gets worse. If you're only syncing the position, the barrel may be pushed off the conveyor on a client, and it's movement will be stopped.
But the server will still send it position updates according to the server barrel's movement. Barrels can move a lot in a fifth of a second, so that
could look really bad.
<p>
So although we had a good idea and it can work pretty well, you're going to have to explain that your patch won't work over the internet on slow
connections.

<h4>Communication</h4>

The different methods of communicating between cogs are covered in the comm tutorial, but the only one we're concerned with here is triggers.
Briefly, triggers are sent out to one or all computers with SendTrigger() and received with a trigger handler. Triggers are sent with an ID so that
you can tell them apart. They're our only option for multiplayer comm, but they're not too bad.
<p>
Make sure you put plenty of comments beside your triggers. Although we've talked about client-side and server-side code as being in seperate
cogs, you can easily put them in the same cog, and many editors do. Take a look at this example:

<pre class="code">
pulse:
	// pulse is run only by the serving computer.

	for(i=0; i < maxBarrels - 1; i=i+1)
	{
		// just to make the code easier to read.
		pos = GetThingPos(barrel0[i]);
		// send out the trigger to all computers (us too).
		// can't send a whole vector, so we'll break it up.
		SendTrigger(-1, 35, VectorX(pos), VectorY(pos), VectorZ(pos), i);
		// we don't want to flood our network with
		// triggers, so sleep for a very short while.
		Sleep(broadcast_interval);
	}

return;

trigger:
	// if this is a trigger this local cog is sending, ignore it.
	if(GetSenderRef() == GetSelfCog()) return;

	if(GetSourceRef() == 35)
	{
		// receiving a barrel pos update from a server.
		// first, rebuild the vector.
		pos = VectorSet(GetParam(0), GetParam(1), GetParam(2));
		// now set the local barrel's pos.
		SetThingPos(barrel0[GetParam(3)], pos);
	}

return;
</pre>

Something not obvious in the example above is that the thing numbers of things created in the game after startup will not
be the same on all computers. That's why we have to keep an array of all of the barrels we create. And when we send
out pos updates, the index number is sent. So as long as we make sure our arrays are set up correctly, there won't be a
problem.
<p>
This example for the scenario we worked with earlier shows how a cog must be prepared
to be run on several different computers. Only the server will use the pulse message, and it will ignore updates
that it sends to itself. However, all of the clients will respond to the trigger and reset their barrels' positions.
<p>
Our example's cog is assumed to have the 0x40 flag which must be added if it's not going to be an inventory cog. Cog does have
a syncing verb for positions, but it doesn't just set the new position - it tries to move them to their new position sometimes making
the situation worse.
