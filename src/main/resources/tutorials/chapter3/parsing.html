<h4>Introduction</h4>

<i>Parsing</i> is a term used to describe how computers read data from a file. Typically, a program will open the file,
and then read it line by line or character by character into memory. Sometimes the program won't need to store the file,
so it will drop one line as soon as it reads the next.
<p>
We can't say for certain how JK reads cogs, but most parsers are pretty standard, so we'll go over the simple things
that will help you understand how cogs are read. At least then you'll know how Parsec works. :-)
<p>
Most parsers will ignore extra whitespace (spaces, tabs, and CRLFs which is a combination of two characters: a carriage
return and a line feed). But JK is very strict about whitespace until it gets to the code section. I.e., you can only have one
symbol declaraction per line whereas you can have as many statements as you want on one line.
<p>
Most parsers work by looking for keywords. They seperate keywords with delimiters - these are special characters like
operators, colons, semicolons, and the whitespace characters. So at any given line and character in the file, the parser
will look at a string of characters from its current position until the next delimiter. If this string matches a keyword that
the parser is looking for, then depending what keyword it is, the parser will look for whatever is supposed to come after it.

<h4>Header and Flags</h4>

The header is, of course, all comments. As soon as the parser sees that pound sign, it's going to ignore the rest of the
line - it doesn't matter what comes after it.
<p>
At this point, JK is looking for two things: the flags keyword or the symbols keyword. So JK is going to look at the beginning
of each line these words. It's taken for granted that if there's a space or something before the keyword, JK will look for the
keyword after the space.
<p>
Once the parser finds the flags keyword, it's going to look for the assignment afterwords. Now in most cases, spaces can
be put in anywhere, but JK is very picky about spaces that come after the flags assigment - if it finds any, it will consider it
a syntax error because it doesn't expect them to be there.
<p>
This is probably because JK doesn't care about making the flags line work like a real assignment so it's search for "flags="
and it's taking from the seventh character to the last non-space character as the assigned number. Once it sees that the
number's not valid - because there's a space in it, it halts and the cog is not loaded.

<h4>Symbols Parsing</h4>

After the flags, JK's parser looks for the symbols keyword. The parser will go line after line until it reaches the end of the
file looking for this keyword. If it doesn't find it, there's a syntax error and the parser stops.
<p>
When it does find symbols, the parser now has a new list of keywords to look for. These are the symbol type names
and the "end" for the end of the section. If it finds something else, it will probably try to ignore it and go on to the next
line, but if it can't (perhaps you forgot the end keyword) it will either reach the end of the cog or assume there's been
a syntax error.
<p>
Once the parser sees a symbol type (e.g., message) it's going to look for the name, and then any extensions which
might come after it. The only delimiters the parser is allowing at this point are spaces and of course the end of the line (which
is a CRLF).

<h4>Code Parsing</h4>

After finding the end for the symbols section, the parser will be looking only for the code keyword. Anything else has to
be an immediate syntax error. But once inside the code section, the parser acts much differently. It will first be expecting
a word followed by a colon, but once it finds that first label and until it finds the end of the code section, it won't be looking
for a few specific keywords.
<p>
Although we can't know for sure what JK does, it most likely takes in the first word and then looks at the next non-whitespace
delimiter. If it's an equals sign, then the parser can tell that this is an assignment and the string that came before it must be
a variable name. If we were doing syntax checking, we'd have stored all of the variables names read in the symbols section
and then we'd know if this variable has been declared.
<p>
After the equals sign, the parser is expecting something that returns a value. This could be a function, a variable, a number,
or a math operation. The parser will read characters until it finds a delimiter it's looking for. If it finds a opening parentheses,
this must be a function, so the parser will then look up the function and check for the parameters it's supposed to have.
<p>
If the parser finds a delimiter that's a math symbol then it knows there's an operation that needs to be performed, and there could
be numbers or variables in there. For error checking, we could be checking the type of the assigned variable to make sure that
it matches the return type of the function. Or in the case of the operation, we could check to make sure all of the variables were
of a type compatible with that operation. E.g., you can't multiply two strings.
<p>
The reason we went over assignments first is that pretty much any type of code can be put somewhere into an assignment. The
main thing to remember about code parsing is that a parser will usually look to the next delimiter to find out what the previous string
is. And statements are always ended with a semicolon so that the parser will know that it's just read a complete statement. After
the semicolon, parsers will be expecting either the beginning of another statement or the end of the line.
<p>
JK's parser goes through all of the code like this until it finds an end for the code section. At this point it stops, there's no reason
to look after this because nothing's supposed to be there - it doesn't matter if there is.
