In this tutorial, we're going to go over the basic decision process of debugging something you've written.
Once you get used to it, this will all seem pretty easy, but it takes most editors a while to learn how to
debug their code. Too many beginners go straight to a message board or chat room because they
don't know how to debug properly.

<h4>Print Verbs</h4>

The print verbs that JK provides are probably the most helpful debugging tool. If you've just typed out
a small cog and nothing's happening in the game (definitely the most common problem you'll face), put
a print statement in the startup handler to make sure your cog is actually running. Remember that you'll
need to use a sleep of about two seconds depending on how long your machine takes to start the game
after startup.
<p>
Although Print() is the most common, there's a ton of <a href="../../cog/verbs/print/print_frame.html">Print Verbs</a>
available to you. These verbs are pretty self exaplanatory, so I don't want to write a tutorial just for them, but
they are very useful for debugging so I'll squeeze them in here.
<p>
<i>Concatenation</i> means to link or join together IRL. In programming, concatenation (or just concat for short)
is the term we use to describe adding strings together. In some languages, the '+' operator is overloaded (given
another purpose) to concatenate strings. So you'd be able to write: <code>stringVar = 'word1' + 'word2';</code>
And stringVar would have a value of "word1word2".
<p>
But we're not that fortuneate with Cog. Instead, we're given the same functionality with the concat verbs. JK keeps
a string set aside in its memory for use with these verbs. And this string is not cleared unless you clear it. So the
first thing you do when you concat strings is to clear whatever was left over from the last concat operation. To do
that, we use JKStringClear().
<p>
We can concat ASCII strings, flexes, ints, players' names, UNI strings, spaces, and vectors - we're given a lot
of flexibility. Concatting (author's terminology, not to be repeated. :) ASCII (think of this as a simple computer alphabet)
strings are entered as strings, e.g., <code>JKStringConcatASCIIString("yourTextHere");</code>
<p>
For flexes and integers, you can either concat them the same way the regular print verbs display them, or you can
use the ConcatFormatted verbs which allow you to use format specifiers - these give you a lot of options for
customizing how the numbers will appear. Format specifiers aren't part of Cog, but of Visual C++. The <a href="../../cog/verbs/print/print_frame.html">Print Verbs</a>
notes includes a complete description of the specifiers that Cog can use. The best use of these specifiers is to
output numbers in hexadecimal - very useful for checking flags.
<p>
The Concat verbs are the only way to retreive a player's name, but there's not much you can do with it except
to print it. This isn't helpful for debugging - just for displaying scores. Concatting a UNI string is pretty useless because
there's already a UNI print verb, and there's not any reason to want to concat a predefined string.
<p>
Concatting a space is also pretty useless because you can do that with the ConcatASCII verb. Concatting a vector
is very usefull for debugging when you need to look at several vectors at once. If you just printed them out, they'd
all appear in the same column and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart. But with the concat verbs, you can print
as many as you need in one line.

<h4>Results of Print</h4>

So your cog's not working right, and you've just tried putting a print in the startup handler. If nothing printed (and you had
a sleep of at least two seconds), then first make sure you correctly declared the startup message. If that's there,
then you need to make sure that your cog is being loaded. If your cog is correctly listed in either the items.dat or the cogs
section of a JKL, then you must have a syntax error.
<p>
The most common syntax error is a missing semicolon somwhere in your cog. Or maybe you've got a missing code or end
keyword. Sometimes the error will be subtle - like having spaces in the flags assignment - the cog looks fine, but when JK
parsed (read through) the cog, it found something it didn't expect and this caused it to read in garbage.
<p>
Now if the print did work, then you know the cog is being loaded and your syntax is (for the most part) correct. If you ever
see the print appear twice, then your cog is being loaded twice - check for duplicate entries.
<p>
Once you're done with that basic troubleshooting step, how to proceed depends on your situation. Say you have a certain
message handler that's not running. You've put a print in that handler but nothing's printing. It's probably an event message
for an event that's not occuring (or the cog is not associated with the object(s) it happened to).
<p>
If you know for a fact that
the event did occur to an associated object, then the cog may be blocked from receiving that message. Mask flags are the
most common cause (the defaults are very restrictive). In a class or inventory cog, you can do nothing; the only way to change mask flags is to use a level
cog and the mask symbol extension to allow any sourceref for that event message.
<p>
They key to effectively solving problems with portions of your code not working, is to start by putting print commands at
startup and work down to where the problem is. Once you find the point of no return in your code, check the surrounding
syntax - you might have missed something easy like a semicolon right after an if statement. If it's not obvious then check
your references for any comments on the verbs or keywords you're using. If you have questions about a verb or its syntax,
most of the time it's a common enough question to be in a reference somewhere.

<h4>Flow Control Errors</h4>

<i>Flow control</i> is a phrase that programmers use to describe how code execution flows down through your code.
Sleeps, Calls, Pulses, Loops, and If-else statements are all methods to allow programmers to change the normal top-down flow control of
a program or script. Normally, an event is received by a cog and code execution starts right after the label and ends when the
return command is given.
<p>
A Sleep() pauses code execution, but it's a lot more complicated than that because JK has to remember where it stopped
in the code and what it was doing at the time. In the Threads tutorial, this is gone over in a lot more depth, but basically
you have a limit on how many sleeps you can have simultaneously. Putting a sleep in a pulse handler (which is always
a bad idea) where the sleep is longer than the pulse interval will result in what the author will call a thread overflow -
basically JK is trying to run the pulse handler, but it already has so many paused code executions in memory that it has
no more room to create more. Timers do not have this problem and should be used instead of sleeps if possible.
<p>
Calls are similar to sleeps in that current code execution is paused while JK calls on another handler. If you nest one call
inside another so many times that you hit the thread limit, the oldest thread will be deleted. So code execution will never
resume in the handler that made the first call.
<p>
Loops, in all their different forms, have a block of code that's run, and a condition that's evaluated to see if that code
should be run again. If the condition is true, then the flow of code execution resumes at the beginning of the loop's
code block or statement.
<p>
If statements, especially ones that are deeply nested with elses, can also be a source of errors if you don't use proper
indentation. Flow control can be difficult to imagine as you're reading your code if you can't clearly see which
else belongs to which if.
<p>
To avoid errors like these, try to keep in mind how JK will read through your code and make decisions instead of just
how the code reads to you. Some operations that seem simple to read might have a lot of hidden overhead that JK nicely
hides from us.
