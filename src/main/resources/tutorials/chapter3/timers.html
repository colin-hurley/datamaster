<h4>Introduction</h4>

As you become familiar with Cog, you'll need to learn how to use timed code to create your effects at a later
time than the present. With normal programming, this idea would never be considered - when an application needs
to do something, it will perform the action as soon as it can. But with a virtual environment, you'll need delays in your
code to make effects seem more natural or continuous.
<p>
For creating a delayed effect, Cog provides timers. These are special events which are triggered when a countdown
timer expires. For creating a continuous effect, Cog provides pulses. Pulses are much like timers, but pulses keep going -
after the pulse countdown timer expires and the pulse event occurs, the timer is automatically reset.

<h4>Using Timers</h4>

The verbs you'll use to set a timer
are SetTimerEx(), SetTimer(), and SetThingTimer(). SetTimer() is the simple version - it has one parameter for the delay. You would
use SetTimer() if you're only going to have one timer at a time. SetTimerEx() allows you to give your timers
an ID and two parameters along with the delay. And SetThingTimer() works much like SetTimer() except that you're setting
a timer for a thing instead of setting a timer for a cog.
<p>
As soon as a timer is set, JK will start a countdown for the timer's delay. When the countdown ends, the timer
is said to expire and a timer event message is sent. If this is a simple or extended timer, then only the cog you
set the timer in will receive the message. If this is a thing timer, then all of the thing's associated cogs will receive
the message. For extended timers, you can retreive the ID and parameter values with GetSenderID() and GetParam(), or
if this is a thing timer, you can use GetSenderRef() to find the thing that sent it.
<p>
If you need to stop an extended timer before it expires, you can use KillTimerEx() - the one parameter it needs is the timer's ID.
Timers set by SetTimer() and SetThingTimer() need to be stopped with SetTimer(0) and SetThingTimer(thing, 0) respectively.
As an example for using timers, we'll look at LEC's xtank1.cog:

<pre class="code">
damaged:
   barrel = GetSenderRef();
   damage = GetParam(0);
   barrelhealth = GetThingUserData(barrel);

   if(GetParam(1) == 1) Return;              // barrel won't be damaged by damage type impact

   if(barrelhealth <= damage)                // is this enough damage to kill the barrel ?
   {
      SetTimerEx(0.5, barrel, 0, 0);         // prepare to kill the barrel in 0.6 second
      Return;
   }

   SetThingUserData(barrel, barrelhealth - damage);
   Return;

# ............................................................................................

timer:
   KillTimerEx(GetSenderId());
   CreateThing(barrel_exp, GetSenderId());   // create an explosion
   DestroyThing(GetSenderId());              // Destroy the barrel
   Return;
</pre>

This is the same cog that we mentioned in the threads tutorial when we were talking about sleeps. If we explode the barrel
immediately after it's damaged, then players won't have time to get away and we'd lose that element of suspense. Using a
sleep here would be bad because we can easily have more than five barrels blow up at the same time - the thread limit would
be exceeded and not all of the barrels would blow up.
<p>
The solution is to use timers. We need to use IDed timers because more than one barrel can be waiting to explode. To get something
unique for a timer's ID, we can use the barrel's thing number. And in the timer handler, we can retrieve the ID and use it to identify
the barrel.
<p>
Notice that KillTimerEx() is used to stop a timer that has the same ID as the one that has expired. We're doing this as a safeguard
in case two timers were set for the same barrel. We can't destroy something twice, but we shouldn't have to worry about the
consequences. Also, thing numbers are not unique to one object in a game. Once an object is removed from gameplay, a thing
number is free to be reused. So in some circumstances, you should check a thing's signature to make sure that your thing hasn't been
destroyed and the number used for something else. <!-- Syntactically incorrect? Probably so, but it sounds ok this way, and
who cares about traditional grammar? :-/  -->

<h4>Using Pulses</h4>

A pulse works just like a timer set with SetTimer() - the difference is that a pulse automatically resets itself after its timer expires.
If you need to create a continuous effect for an extended period of time, then it's a given that you'll need to run the same code
every so many seconds. Pulses are more convenient for us to use because we don't have to reset them, and using a pulse
frees up our timer messages for other things.
<p>
A pulse is set with SetPulse() or SetThingPulse(), and it's stopped with SetPulse(0) and SetThingPulse(0). SetPulse() works with
just one cog like SetTimer(). SetThingPulse() works with a thing just like SetThingTimer().
<p>
Suppose, for example, that you want to create a rain effect in part of your level. What you need to do is create
rain objects and make them fall towards the floor - as soon as they touch a surface, they can be removed. This is an effect that
needs the same code to run in short intervals. For the sake of example:

<pre class="code">
#--------------------------------------------------------
startup:
	SetPulse(burstInterval);

Return;
#--------------------------------------------------------
pulse:
	for(i=0; i < numBurstElements; i=i+1) SetTimerEx(Rand(), Rand() * 6, 0, 0);

Return;
#--------------------------------------------------------
timer:
	if(GetSenderID() > 5) Return;	// just in case Rand() actually returns 1
	parent = ghost0[GetSenderID()];
	precip=FireProjectile(parent, precipTemp, -1, -1, RandVec(), '0 0 0', elementSpeedMult, 0x1, 0, 0);
	SetThingVel(precip, VectorSet(xMove, yMove, VectorZ(GetThingVel(precip))));

Return;
#--------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

Both pulses and timers are used to create the rain effect. Timer doesn't have to be used, the pulse could be a little bit faster,
but this rain implementation is using bursts with different intervals than the raindrops in the burst. This example shows that
by using a pulse, you can use timers for other things.
