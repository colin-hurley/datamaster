Welcome to the DataMaster's Jedi Knight programming tutorial. In this tutorial, we'll start off with a basic understanding of Jedi Knight and then get to
scripting concepts. After that we'll go on to basic syntax and writing cogs. And in the third chapter, we'll get to the stuff that most people never understand.
Cog is a very simple language to learn, and if you read carefully, you'll understand most of what you need to start hacking into JK by the time you're done.
<P>
It doesn't matter if you have programming experience or not, but if you do - especially anything related to C++, Cog will be
even easier for you to understand. The hardest thing is not learning the syntax - it's getting a fundamental understanding
of the way JK works.
