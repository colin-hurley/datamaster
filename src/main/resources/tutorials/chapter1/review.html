Right now, you should understand how JK loads levels and the resources for them. You should understand how cogs
are loaded into memory, and how cogs relate to levels, templates, and the inventory.
<p>
There are no code examples in this chapter because you should be familiar with what cog has to do before you try
use it. Going straight to cog's syntax would be a mistake because you'd have nothing to base your understanding on.
