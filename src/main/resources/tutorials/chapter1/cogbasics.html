<h4>Cog Files</h4>

Cog files are just regular text files with a .cog extension. Jedi Knight will look for cog files in a resource subfolder named cog.
This folder can be in several different places - which we'll cover later on.
<P>
It's easy to think of a "cog" as a simple piece of text. But text won't do anything by itself. When JK loads a level and all the cogs
needed for it, these cogs are stored in memory. When JK needs to use one of them, it reads the information it loaded from the cog
file and performs whatever instructions the cog contained. The point is that the cog does nothing - it is simply a text file that
JK interprets when it needs to.
<P>
Each time JK finds a entry for a cog file, it will load that cog into memory. It doesn't matter
if there's more than entry for a cog - multiple copies of a cog can run in memory with no connection to each other.

<h4>Events</h4>

Cogscripts are event based. An event happens in the game, and JK looks for code to run for that event. There may or may not be code
for that event, and for some events JK doesn't bother using cogs. But every cog works by associating itself with either some part of the
level or an object in it. When something happens to one of the cog's associated objects, JK will process the event and look for corresponding
code in that cog.
<P>
Cogs are often called cogscripts (or just scripts) because in programming, a script is interpreted code with subroutines that are run
when events occur. An event that has a subroutine assigned to it is called a scripted event. You should be able to see how the
term "script" has been borrowed from it's meaning in theatrical plays.

<h4>Cog Types</h4>

There are three different types of cogs: level, class, and inventory cogs. They're all scripts and have the same syntax, but JK uses them for
different things. Level cogs are loaded by a jedi knight level file (or jkl). This file contains all of the level's geometry and listings for
every type of resource that JK needs to load the level. Level cogs are usually loaded to control specific objects in the game like elevators
and doors.
<p>
Class cogs are also listed in the jkl file, but in a different section. Whereas level cogs are loaded to control specific things that will be
in the level, class cogs are assigned to types of things like players, stormtroopers, and grenades. Class cogs may control many
objects in the game at once.
<p>
Inventory or items cogs are loaded by the items.dat file. The items.dat is responsible for remembering what items your player "owns" while
he's in a level. And inventory cogs control these items. Your weapons, items, force powers, and shields are all listed in the items.dat
and controlled by inventory cogs.
