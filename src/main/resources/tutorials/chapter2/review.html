In the chapter, you've learned the syntax of a cog file, and a little about how to use it. The symbols section is easy to understand, but
the code section is so complicated that only a small part of it can be covered in a tutorial like this. Everything you need to know is in this reference,
and once you're done with this tutorial, you should read through the reference to gain a broader understanding of the commands available
to you.
<p>
The "Writing Cogs" tutorial is intended to teach you how to write a cog. But not by showing you what to write, it's supposed to teach you
how to come up with a good design and implement it.

Chapter 2 is the end of the beginner's section of this tutorial. You can either go on to chapter 3 now, or you can try editing for a while first.
Chapter 3 contains information you need to know, but until you've gained some experience, it might not make much sense.
