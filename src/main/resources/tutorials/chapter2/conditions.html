<h4>If Statement</h4>

The if statement allows you to check something in your cog or in the game and execute code based on the result. Suppose
that you want to make sure your player is alive before letting him fire his weapon. In this example, the if statement is used to do
that:

<pre class="code">
fire:
	if(GetThingHealth(player) < 1) // end firing and return.

	// continue with firing.

Return;
</pre>

GetThingHealth() is a verb that returns the value of a thing's health. If this value is less than 1, then we can assume that the player
has no health and is dead. JK will evaluate this less-than operation and return true if the player's health is less than 1 or false if it's
not. When the if statement has a true value, it runs the following line or block of code. Here we have a comment to
explain what code would be there.
<p>
Now in some cases you'll need to run code only if the condition was false or you may need to check a few more conditions.
To do this, you chain if statements together to look like this:

<pre class="code">
startup:
	if(var1 == var2) // do this
	else if(var1 == var3) // do this again
	else if(var1 == var4) // do this again
	else if(var1 == var5) // do this again
	else if(var1 == var6) // do this again
	else // do that.
Return;
</pre>

Or you can use one if statement and the else keyword.

<pre class="code">
startup:
	if(var1 == var2) // do this
	else // do that.
Return;
</pre>

The code after an else statement will only run if the last if statement had a false value. As you see in the first example, you can chain
many if statements with the else keyword. In this last example, if statements are used with code blocks:

<pre class="code">
if(var1 == 1)
{
	// code line 1
	// code line 2
}
else if(var1 == 2)
{
	// code line 1
	// code line 2
}
else
{
	// code line 1
	// code line 2
}
</pre>

It makes no difference whether you have a single statement or a code block after a conditional statement.

</pre>

<h4>Conditions</h4>

<i>Condition</i> is a word used to refer to the expression used by conditional statements. For the if statement, the condition is enclosed by
a set of parentheses. This expression can be a lot more complicated than in the examples you've seen.
<p>
First, a value of 1 is a true value, and a value of 0 is a false value. There is a variable type specifically for this kind of value called
boolean. Cog does not use this type, but because it is a programming standard, we commonly refer to a true or false value as being
boolean. Remember that all conditions must be evaluated to a boolean value.
<p>
Most conditions are simple relational tests - one value or variable is compared to another. For example:

<pre class="code">
if(var1 == 1) // go!
else if(var1 <= 1) // go!
else if(var1 >= 1) // go!
else if(var1 < 1) // go!
else if(var1 > 1) // go!
</pre>

These are all relational tests which you should know from your mathmatics classes. But unlike math, we will evaluate a relational test
and find a boolean value. For this next example, var1 has a value of 1:

<pre class="code">
if(var1 == 1) // go!
if(1 == 1) // go!
if(1) // go!
</pre>

These three lines of code are intended to show you how JK evaluates a relational test. And since 1 is a true value, we will go!
Now let's assume that var1 is 5:

<pre class="code">
if(var1 == 1) // go!
if(5 == 1) // go!
if(0) // go!
</pre>

Because 5 is not equal to 1, the result was 0 - and because 0 is false value, the following code wasn't executed. In this case, had there
been an else statement, the else statement's code would have been executed.

<h4>Logical Operators</h4>

Now we're going to look at using logical operators in our conditions. A relational test is just a simple comparision, but one condition combine
many tests and reverse their boolean value.
<p>
<b>The "not" operator:</b> This operator is symbolized by an exclamation mark. It's purpose is to reverse the value of a condition. An example:

<pre class="code">
var=5;
if(!var < 1) // Do something.
</pre>

Five is not less than one, so the relational test is false. But, the not operator reverses the value to true. Look at this example:

<pre class="code">
var=0;
if(!var) // Run code
</pre>

Var has a value of zero. And since zero is false, the condition would normally be false and would not run the code. But the not operator
changes the value to 1, and the code is run. Note that the not operator must be placed at the beginning of the relational test - either inside
or outside a pair of parentheses. Here are a few more examples that are all true: 

<pre class="code">
if(!(0)) // Do stuff
if(!0) // Do stuff
if(!(5 < 5)) // Run code

if(!7 == 6)
{
   // Run code
}
</pre>

<b>The "and" operator:</b> This operator, symbolized by two ampersands ( '&&' ), is used to combine two relational tests into one condition.
For example: 

<pre class="code">
if(var1 < 5 && var2 < 10) // Do something
</pre>

The logical "and" operator requires that both relational tests be true for the entire condition to be true. Notice that the relational tests are not
enclosed by parentheses. LEC and many cog programmers choose to do this, but it is not necessary. Because Logical Operators have a
lower precedence than Relational Operators, the relational tests are performed first, and then the "and" operators are processed. It is because
of this that you don't have to enclose relational tests in parentheses to force them to be processed first. If you did enclose the seperate
conditions, they would look like this: 

<pre class="code">
if((var1 < 5) && (var2 < 10)) // Run code
</pre>

When the relational tests in a condition are evaulated, the value of the test is used in place of the relational test. It would look something
like this: 

<pre class="code">
if(1 && 0 && 1 && 1 && 1) // Run code
</pre>

In that example, 1 out of five relational tests was false. Because all tests had to be true for the entire condition to be true, the condition
was false and the code was not run. Here are two more examples: 

<pre class="code">
if(var1 == 5 && var2 == 3 && var3 == 0) // Run code
if(!var1 && var2 && var3 == 10) // Run code
</pre>

<b>The "or" operator:</b> This operator is denoted with two braces like this, ' || '. This operator will make a condition true if either of two relational
tests is true. For example: 

<pre class="code">
if(var1 < 3 || var2 == 10) // Run code
</pre>

If either relational test was true, then the condition would be true and the code would be run. As with the "and" operator, the relational tests
are usually enclosed by parentheses, but don't have to be.
