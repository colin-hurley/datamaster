Variables (or symbols) are like storage places with a name. We store values in variables. These values
can be numbers or text. All variables should be declared in the symbols section. A symbol
declaration tells JK to reserve memory for the value that the variable will be given
in the code section. With most variables, you can assign an initial value when you declare the
variable.
<p>
On this page, I'm going to explain how to declare and use the different types of variables that JK uses.
For more technical information on variable types, look in the <A href="../../cog/symbols/types_frame.html">Symbol Types</A> section
of this reference.

<h4>Integers</h4>

An integer is a whole number - a number without a fractional portion. You'll use integers more than
anything else when writing cogs. A typical declaration looks like this:

<pre class="code">
int     yourInt=1
</pre>

int is short for integer. With every variable that you define, the variable's type will come first. Next
is the variable's name - in this case, <i>yourInt</i>. In this declaration, the integer is given an
initial value of 1. You can also add arguments after the declaration which tell JK how to use the
variable - we'll cover that later on this page.

<h4>Floating Point Numbers</h4>

Floating point numbers, or floats, are numbers with a fractional portion. They're called floats because the
decimal point is said to "float" between digits (note that it's a mistake to say that it's a "decimal point" because
there's nothing about a floating point that's restricted to base 10).
<p>
JK has two floating point types: float and flex. Apparently, both types are exactly the same. Float is the standard
programming term, but flex is more commonly used in Cog. Their declarations look like this:

<pre class="code">
float     yourFloat=1.1
flex      yourFlex=1.2
</pre>

Floats are most often used to store physics variables like speed, mass, and vector axes.

<h4>Templates</h4>

Templates are defined by giving the template's name as it's listed in its JKL file. Template variables
are usually used to get a reference to a specific template since you won't normally refer to a template by
name in the code section. A declaration looks like this:

<pre class="code">
template     yourTemp=+tempName
</pre>

A template contains an integer value. This integer is the template's number in its JKL's listing. For the static.jkl,
there is an offset number that's added to the list number.

<h4>Vectors</h4>

Vectors are special variables that store three floating point numbers. Vectors do not accept an initial value
in the symbols section but you can pass a value to them from a JKL. Their declaration looks like this:

<pre class="code">
vector     yourVec
</pre>

A vector's value can be expressed in several different ways, but when passing a value from a JKL, you'll
use the form <code>(x/y/z)</code>.

<h4>File Variables</h4>

File variables are used to get a reference to a resource file (to save space and time, all of the variables
that just load resource files are grouped together here). They are declared like this:

<pre class="monocode">
ai        yourAI=example.ai
material  yourMat=example.mat
sound     yourSound=example.wav
keyframe  yourKey=example.key
model     yourModel=example.3do
</pre>

Notice that no path is given. JK will look for these files in their respective resource subfolders. All of these variable
types contain integer values. This value will be the number of the resource in its JKL's list for that file type. In some cases,
JK will add a resource that's not already in the JKL's list.

<h4>Cog</h4>

Cog variables do not refer to an actual .cog file. Remember from before that cogs are useless to us as a piece of text.
Cog variables hold an integer - this integer is the cog's index number in the jkl's list. This is why cogs aren't given an
initial value, their value needs to be passed from the level - because the level knows exactly what a cog's number will be.
The declaration looks like:

<pre class="code">
cog     yourCog
</pre>

<h4>Messages</h4>

Messages are declared in the symbols section to tell JK what events the cog is listening for. Messages aren't "used" in the
code section like other variables. Their declaration looks like this:

<pre class="code">
message     startup
</pre>

Message variables must be given message names (refer the the <A href="../../cog/message/messages_frame.html">Messages Section</A> for a listing). Like most variables, messages hold
integer values, but these values are set within JK's executable. Messages are only declared so that JK will see the declarations, you
can tell by printing the value of an undeclared message that the cog already knows what a message's value is.

<h4>Thing</h4>

A thing declaration looks like this:

<pre class="code">
thing	     yourThing
</pre>

Things have integer values - the number of the thing in the thing list. You can give them initial values just like integers, but it's not that helpful
from the cog itself. A thing that's already placed in the level should be left open for the level's JKL to define.

<h4>Surface</h4>

Surface variables contain the integer number of surfaces in the JKL's list. Their declaration looks like this:

<pre class="code">
surface    yourSurf
</pre>

Surfaces should be left open for the level to define.

<h4>Sector</h4>

A sector is a group of surfaces that form a room. Level geometry is created by adjoining (combining) sectors.
Like surfaces, sectors are integers containing the value of a sector in the JKL's list. Their declarations look like:

<pre class="code">
sector     yourSec
</pre>

Sectors should be left open for the level to define.

<h4>String</h4>

Cog doesn't really have a string symbol type, but in the code section you can assign strings to string values,
and they will keep the value. We know that there is no string symbol type that you can use in the symbols section
because it would be written in the exe with the other types.
<p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom:0">More About Variables</h2><hr>

<h4>Passing from a JKL</h4>

Level cogs receive their events from things that the level defines for them. Let's say our cog's symbols looks like this:

<pre class="code">
symbols

thing     myThing

message  created

end
</pre>

And the cog's listing in the level JKL looks like this:

<pre class="code">
Section: cogs
World cogs 10
#Num	Script          Symbol values
0:	yourCog.cog 18
end
</pre>

The value of 18 is being passed to the variable myThing. So when the level finishes loading, myThing will have a value
of 18. This is how the level defines variables.
<p>
When the level passes a thing, sector, or surface value to one of its cogs, it associates the cog with that object. In our
example above, yourCog will receive the created message from myThing.
<p>
If you don't want to define a variable in the JKL, or you do but don't want to receive its events, you'll need to add
symbol extensions after your variable.

<h4>Symbol Extensions</h4>

After a variable's declaration, you can add arguments that tell JK how to use the variable. These arguments will be refered to
as symbol extensions in this reference. And they are: desc, local, mask, linkid, and nolink.
<p>
<b>Desc</b> serves only to add commenting to a variable. A typical use would look like:

<pre class="code">
thing     myThing     desc=this_is_my_thing
</pre>

JK won't complain either way, but it's considered bad syntax to have spaces or special characters in the description.
<p>
<b>Local</b> is the most common extension used in cog. This extension tells JK that the variable will not be given a value by the JKL.
For example, let's say your symbols looks like this:

<pre class="code">
symbols

thing     myThing
int       myVar     local
thing     myOtherThing

message  created

end
</pre>

And your JKL looks like this:

<pre class="code">
Section: cogs
World cogs 10
#Num	Script          Symbol values
0:	yourCog.cog 18 20
end
</pre>

myThing will be given a value of 18, and myOtherThing will be given the value of 20. Because myVar had the local extension,
JK skipped over it when it assigned the JKL's values.
<p>
<b>Mask</b> is used to limit the events that the cog receives from a thing. All events have source and a sender. The source is the thing
that caused the event. And the sender is the thing that the event happened to. When the event happens to the sender, it will
send a message out to its cogs telling them what's happened. The message includes the thing that caused the event - the source.
<p>
<A href="../../flags/thingtypemask/thingtypemask_frame.html">Mask Flags</A> are used to block messages that have irrelevant sources. Let's say you want your cog to listen for the touched event
of a thing so that your cog can do something when the thing is shot. If the thing is touched by the player, you don't want him to
do anything. Instead of adding extra code to your cog to make sure the source of the touched event is a laser, you can use mask
flags to block out events caused by players.
<p>
For this example, the declaration would look like:

<pre class="code">
thing     myThing     mask=0x8
</pre>

Flags have not been covered yet, so it's ok if 0x8 makes no sense. The 0x8 flag tells JK that only the cog will only receive messages
of events that were caused by a weapon. If we wanted the reverse - if we wanted only events caused by the player and nothing else,
the flag would be 0x400. If we wanted both players and weapons, the flag would be 0x408.
<p>
Remember that there are default masks for things, sectors, and surfaces. These are explained in the symbols documentation.
By using the mask extension, you are overriding this default. To receive all the messages that a thing sends, use a flag of 0xfff.
<p>
<b>Linkid</b> is used to make a group out of a bunch of symbols so that it's easier to refer to them in the code section. A declaration looks like:

<pre class="code">
thing     myThing     linkid=1
thing     myOtherThing     linkid=1
</pre>

Then in the code section, you'd be able to refer to all the objects that have a linkid of 1 instead of having to write the variable name of
every one of the objects in your group.
<p>
<b>Nolink</b> is used when you want to define a thing in the JKL, but you don't want to listen to any of its events. Its declaration looks like:

<pre class="code">
thing     myThing     nolink
</pre>

<p>
In some cases, you may want a single variable to use multiple symbol extensions. To do so, specify both extensions and separate them with a
comma. For example:

<pre class="code">
thing     myThing     mask=0x405,linkid=1
</pre>

<p>
Remember that all of these symbol extensions are only useful in level cogs. To class and inventory cogs, these are useless. However, it's
considered proper syntax to add local to all of a class or inventory cog's variables. This is a way of telling the reader
that all of the variables are being defined within the cog.

<h4>Naming Conventions</h4>

In all of the examples with variables, names like oneWordTwoWord and redFishBlueFish are used. The first character is lowercase to show
that it's a variable - and the beginning of every other word in the name is capitalized to make it easier to read. This method of writing variable
names is often called camel-hump notation.
<p>
Another common method is to use underscores: one_word_two_word and red_fish_blue_fish. In the author's opinion, this is worse because
underscores make you type out more characters, and you get more typos trying to shift-hit the underscore key.
<p>
A constant is a variable that's given a value in the symbols section and never changed in the code section. To make it clear that a constant
shouldn't have its value changed, many programmers use all capital letters: ONEWORDTWOWORD and REDFISHBLUEFISH. This is a good
rule to follow, but it can be an eyesore.
<p>
Keywords, symbol types, and symbol extensions are most often written with lowercase letters. Some programmers prefer to capitalize the first
letter, but it's just not worth your time for keywords that you'll use in most of your cogs.

<h4>Undeclared Variables</h4>

You should always have your variables declared in the symbols section, not doing this is considered to be sloppy coding. But this doesn't mean undeclared
variables won't work. JK is nice enough to recognize that a variable hasn't been declared, so it will declare the variable when
it finds an assignment for it in the code section. Also, JK will convert a variable's type to the type of the value it's assigned to - this is something
you should never do, but be aware that JK does this for you. If you try to retrieve the value of an undeclared variable, JK will return -1 as the value.
<p>
There are memory limits to how many variables you can have in the symbols section. It's not known how these limits work, but declaring
your variables can solve some memory problems.
