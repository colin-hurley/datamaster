<h4>Verb Syntax</h4>

Cog's verbs are the commands that do the work in JK. The term <i>verb</i> is most often used to refer to these commands because this
is an interpreted scripting language (?). But you will also hear these commands refered to as <i>procedures</i> or <i>functions</i>. A 
procedure is a command that simply performs an action, and a fuction is a command that performs an action and then returns a value
to whatever is assigned to it.
<p>
A typical procedure will look like this:

<pre class="code">
DoSomething();
</pre>

The syntax here is simple. The procedure has a name, followed by a set of parentheses to enclose its parameters, and then a semicolon to end
the command. The naming convention of a verb is different from variables in that the first letter is usually capitalized.
<p>
All verbs have a set of parentheses to enclose their parameters. In programming, a parameter is an allotted space for an argument (variable or value)
to be <i>passed to</i> the verb. When an argument is passed to a verb, the verb will use that value to perform whatever command it is meant to do.
It is important to remember that a parameter is only a space for a type of variable, parameters do not have a value - arguments are the values. The
example procedure above has no parameters, but it still must have the parentheses. This procedure has three parameters:

<pre class="code">
DoSomethingMore(1, 2, var3);
</pre>

The first two arguments are given directly as numbers, but the third argument is a variable. The value of this variable will be used by the procedure -
the variable will not be changed (this is known as <i>passing by value</i>). All verbs end with a semicolon - this marks the end of a statement
(or command).
<p>
A function works much the same as a procedure, but the function will return a value to any variable assigned to it. A typical function will look like:

<pre class="code">
myVar = ReturnSomething();
</pre>

myVar is a variable that you have declared in your symbols section. The equals sign is cog's assignment operator - the value taken from the right
will be given to the variable on the left. The function does not need to have a variable assigned to it. Although it's considered bad syntax, you can
leave out the variable assignment and the function will work the same as a procedure.
<p>
When cog reads a verb's parameters, it will start from the right and go to the left. Cog will ignore any extra parameters on the left, and any ones
not entered will have a default value of -1. Note that it's not bad syntax to leave out arguments if they should be given the default value.
