GetCurWeapon()
	JK - returns the bin number of the current weapon
	MotS - returns the current weapon number (probably a bug fix since SetCurWeapon() wants a weapon number in both games, rather than a bin number)
AutoselectWeapon()
	JK - returns the bin number of the weapon chosen by the autoselect query
	MotS - returns the weapon number of the weapon chosen by the autoselect query
RotatePivot()
	See tutorials for detailed comparison of behavior

** Potential differences that need to be confirmed **
AssignWeapon()
	JK - accepts bin number of weapon to select
	MotS - not used, may have been changed to accept weapon number instead of bin, as other verbs were cbanged
SetCurWeapon()
	JK - accepts weapon number
	MotS - may have been changed to accept both weapon numbers and bin numbers, since both seem to be used in the weapon cogs (E.g. bryar uses weapon number while blastech uses bin number)
